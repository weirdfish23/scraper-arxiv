Duration-of-Stay Storage Assignment under Uncertainty,"Michael Lingzhi Li, Elliott Wolf, Daniel Wintz","Optimizing storage assignment is a central problem in warehousing. Past
literature has shown the superiority of the Duration-of-Stay (DoS) method in
assigning pallets, but the methodology requires perfect prior knowledge of DoS
for each pallet, which is unknown and uncertain under realistic conditions. The
dynamic nature of a warehouse further complicates the validity of synthetic
data testing that is often conducted for algorithms. In this paper, in
collaboration with a large cold storage company, we release the first publicly
available set of warehousing records to facilitate research into this central
problem. We introduce a new framework for storage assignment that accounts for
uncertainty in warehouses. Then, by utilizing a combination of convolutional
and recurrent neural network models, ParallelNet, we show that it is able to
predict future shipments well: it achieves up to 29% decrease in MAPE compared
to CNN-LSTM on unseen future shipments, and suffers less performance decay over
time. The framework is then integrated into a first-of-its-kind Storage
Assignment system, which is being piloted in warehouses across the country,
with initial results showing up to 19% in labor savings.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 1 Feb 2020 (this version, v3)]"
Age of Information in a Multiple Access Channel with Heterogeneous Traffic and an Energy Harvesting Node,"Zheng Chen, Nikolaos Pappas, Emil Björnson, Erik G. Larsson","Age of Information (AoI) is a newly appeared concept and metric to
characterize the freshness of data. In this work, we study the delay and AoI in
a multiple access channel (MAC) with two source nodes transmitting different
types of data to a common destination. The first node is grid-connected and its
data packets arrive in a bursty manner, and at each time slot it transmits one
packet with some probability. Another energy harvesting (EH) sensor node
generates a new status update with a certain probability whenever it is
charged. We derive the delay of the grid-connected node and the AoI of the EH
sensor as functions of different parameters in the system. The results show
that the mutual interference has a non-trivial impact on the delay and age
performance of the two nodes.",Information Theory (cs.IT),; Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
Efficient Optimization of Echo State Networks for Time Series Datasets,"Jacob Reinier Maat, Nikos Gianniotis, Pavlos Protopapas","Echo State Networks (ESNs) are recurrent neural networks that only train
their output layer, thereby precluding the need to backpropagate gradients
through time, which leads to significant computational gains. Nevertheless, a
common issue in ESNs is determining its hyperparameters, which are crucial in
instantiating a well performing reservoir, but are often set manually or using
heuristics. In this work we optimize the ESN hyperparameters using Bayesian
optimization which, given a limited budget of function evaluations, outperforms
a grid search strategy. In the context of large volumes of time series data,
such as light curves in the field of astronomy, we can further reduce the
optimization cost of ESNs. In particular, we wish to avoid tuning
hyperparameters per individual time series as this is costly; instead, we want
to find ESNs with hyperparameters that perform well not just on individual time
series but rather on groups of similar time series without sacrificing
predictive performance significantly. This naturally leads to a notion of
clusters, where each cluster is represented by an ESN tuned to model a group of
time series of similar temporal behavior. We demonstrate this approach both on
synthetic datasets and real world light curves from the MACHO survey. We show
that our approach results in a significant reduction in the number of ESN
models required to model a whole dataset, while retaining predictive
performance for the series in each cluster.",Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
Characterization of Local Attitudes Toward Immigration Using Social Media,"Yerka Freire, Eduardo Graells-Garrido","Migration is a worldwide phenomenon that may generate different reactions in
the population. Attitudes vary from those that support multiculturalism and
communion between locals and foreigners, to contempt and hatred toward
immigrants. Since anti-immigration attitudes are often materialized in acts of
violence and discrimination, it is important to identify factors that
characterize these attitudes. However, doing so is expensive and impractical,
as traditional methods require enormous efforts to collect data. In this paper,
we propose to leverage Twitter to characterize local attitudes toward
immigration, with a case study on Chile, where immigrant population has
drastically increased in recent years. Using semi-supervised topic modeling, we
situated 49K users into a spectrum ranging from in-favor to against
immigration. We characterized both sides of the spectrum in two aspects: the
emotions and lexical categories relevant for each attitude, and the discussion
network structure. We found that the discussion is mostly driven by Haitian
immigration; that there are temporal trends in tendency and polarity of
discussion; and that assortative behavior on the network differs with respect
to attitude. These insights may inform policy makers on how people feel with
respect to migration, with potential implications on communication of policy
and the design of interventions to improve inter-group relations.",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),; Computers and Society (cs.CY),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
A Formal Safety Net for Waypoint Following in Ground Robots,"Brandon Bohrer, Yong Kiam Tan, Stefan Mitsch, Andrew Sogokon, André Platzer","We present a reusable formally verified safety net that provides end-to-end
safety and liveness guarantees for 2D waypoint-following of Dubins-type ground
robots with tolerances and acceleration. We: i) Model a robot in differential
dynamic logic (dL), and specify assumptions on the controller and robot
kinematics, ii) Prove formal safety and liveness properties for
waypoint-following with speed limits, iii) Synthesize a monitor, which is
automatically proven to enforce model compliance at runtime, and iv) Our use of
the VeriPhy toolchain makes these guarantees carry over down to the level of
machine code with untrusted controllers, environments, and plans. The
guarantees for the safety net apply to any robot as long as the waypoints are
chosen safely and the physical assumptions in its model hold. Experiments show
these assumptions hold in practice, with an inherent trade-off between
compliance and performance.",Robotics (cs.RO),; Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Systems and Control (eess.SY),"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 18 Jun 2019 (this version, v3)]"
Decay Replay Mining to Predict Next Process Events,"Julian Theis, Houshang Darabi","In complex processes, various events can happen in different sequences. The
prediction of the next event given an a-priori process state is of importance
in such processes. Recent methods have proposed deep learning techniques such
as recurrent neural networks, developed on raw event logs, to predict the next
event from a process state. However, such deep learning models by themselves
lack a clear representation of the process states. At the same time, recent
methods have neglected the time feature of event instances. In this paper, we
take advantage of Petri nets as a powerful tool in modeling complex process
behaviors considering time as an elemental variable. We propose an approach
which starts from a Petri net process model constructed by a process mining
algorithm. We enhance the Petri net model with time decay functions to create
continuous process state samples. Finally, we use these samples in combination
with discrete token movement counters and Petri net markings to train a deep
learning model that predicts the next event. We demonstrate significant
performance improvements and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on nine
real-world benchmark event logs.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 26 Aug 2019 (this version, v3)]"
Empirical analysis of the variability in the flow-density relationship for smart motorways,"Kieran Kalair, Colm Connaughton","The fundamental diagram is an assumed functional relationship between traffic
flow and traffic density. In practice, this relationship is noisy and exhibits
significant statistical variability. On smart motorways, this variability is
increased by variable speed limits that are not captured by the fundamental
diagram. To study this variability, it is appropriate to consider the joint
probability distribution function (pdf) of density and flow. We perform an
empirical study of the variability in the relationship between flow and density
using 74 days of data from 64 sections of London's M25. The objectives are to
determine how much of the variability in the flow-density relationship results
from variable speed limits and to assess whether particular functional forms of
the fundamental diagram are systematically preferred. Empirically, the joint
pdf of flow and density is strongly bimodal, illustrating that traffic flows
are often found in high-density or low-density regimes but rarely in between.
We find that the high-density regime is strongly affected by variable speed
limits whereas the low-density regime is not. The Daganzo-Newell (triangular)
model of the fundamental diagram systematically fits best to the data. However,
the optimal parameters vary with location. Clustering analysis of these
parameters suggests three qualitatively different types of flow-density
relationships applying to different sections of the M25. These clusters have
natural interpretations in terms of the frequency and severity of flow
breakdown. Accident rates also depend on cluster type suggesting possible links
to other properties of traffic flows beyond the flow-density relationship.",Computers and Society (cs.CY),; Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]

fundamental differences between structural subtyping, predominant in functional
programming languages, and nominal subtyping, predominant in object-oriented
programming languages---including differences concerning type negation and
concerning the existence of inductive types, of coinductive types, and of

A Distributed Hierarchical SGD Algorithm with Sparse Global Reduction,"Fan Zhou, Guojing Cong","Reducing communication in training large-scale machine learning applications
on distributed platform is still a big challenge. To address this issue, we
propose a distributed hierarchical averaging stochastic gradient descent
(Hier-AVG) algorithm with infrequent global reduction by introducing local
reduction. As a general type of parallel SGD, Hier-AVG can reproduce several
popular synchronous parallel SGD variants by adjusting its parameters. We show
that Hier-AVG with infrequent global reduction can still achieve standard
convergence rate for non-convex optimization problems. In addition, we show
that more frequent local averaging with more participants involved can lead to
faster training convergence. By comparing Hier-AVG with another popular
distributed training algorithm K-AVG, we show that through deploying local
averaging with fewer number of global averaging, Hier-AVG can still achieve
comparable training speed while frequently get better test accuracy. This
indicates that local averaging can serve as an alternative remedy to
effectively reduce communication overhead when the number of learners is large.
Experimental results of Hier-AVG with several state-of-the-art deep neural nets
on CIFAR-10 and IMAGENET-1K are presented to validate our analysis and show its
superiority.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)","[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 9 Sep 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Universally Slimmable Networks and Improved Training Techniques,"Jiahui Yu, Thomas Huang","Slimmable networks are a family of neural networks that can instantly adjust
the runtime width. The width can be chosen from a predefined widths set to
adaptively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. In this work, we
propose a systematic approach to train universally slimmable networks

generalizing to networks both with and without batch normalization layers. We
further propose two improved training techniques for US-Nets, named the
sandwich rule and inplace distillation, to enhance training process and boost
testing accuracy. We show improved performance of universally slimmable
MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on ImageNet classification task, compared with
individually trained ones and 4-switch slimmable network baselines. We also
evaluate the proposed US-Nets and improved training techniques on tasks of
image super-resolution and deep reinforcement learning. Extensive ablation

proposed methods. Our discovery opens up the possibility to directly evaluate

STRATA: A Unified Framework for Task Assignments in Large Teams of Heterogeneous Agents,"Harish Ravichandar, Kenneth Shaw, Sonia Chernova","Large teams of heterogeneous agents have the potential to solve complex
multi-task problems that are intractable for a single agent working
independently. However, solving complex multi-task problems requires leveraging
the relative strengths of the different kinds of agents in the team. We present
Stochastic TRAit-based Task Assignment (STRATA), a unified framework that
models large teams of heterogeneous agents and performs effective task
assignments. Specifically, given information on which traits (capabilities) are
required for various tasks, STRATA computes the assignments of agents to tasks
such that the trait requirements are achieved. Inspired by prior work in robot
swarms and biodiversity, we categorize agents into different species (groups)
based on their traits. We model each trait as a continuous variable and
differentiate between traits that can and cannot be aggregated from different
agents. STRATA is capable of reasoning about both species-level and agent-level
variability in traits. Further, we define measures of diversity for any given
team based on the team's continuous-space trait model. We illustrate the
necessity and effectiveness of STRATA using detailed experiments based in
simulation and in a capture-the-flag game environment.",Robotics (cs.RO),; Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 6 Feb 2020 (this version, v3)]"
Evaluating the Contextual Integrity of Privacy Regulation: Parents' IoT Toy Privacy Norms Versus COPPA,"Noah Apthorpe, Sarah Varghese, Nick Feamster","Increased concern about data privacy has prompted new and updated data
protection regulations worldwide. However, there has been no rigorous way to
test whether the practices mandated by these regulations actually align with
the privacy norms of affected populations. Here, we demonstrate that surveys
based on the theory of contextual integrity provide a quantifiable and scalable
method for measuring the conformity of specific regulatory provisions to
privacy norms. We apply this method to the U.S. Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA), surveying 195 parents and providing the first data that
COPPA's mandates generally align with parents' privacy expectations for
Internet-connected ""smart"" children's toys. Nevertheless, variations in the
acceptability of data collection across specific smart toys, information types,

A Sequential Set Generation Method for Predicting Set-Valued Outputs,"Tian Gao, Jie Chen, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Michael Witbrock","Consider a general machine learning setting where the output is a set of
labels or sequences. This output set is unordered and its size varies with the
input. Whereas multi-label classification methods seem a natural first resort,
they are not readily applicable to set-valued outputs because of the growth
rate of the output space; and because conventional sequence generation doesn't
reflect sets' order-free nature. In this paper, we propose a unified
framework--sequential set generation (SSG)--that can handle output sets of
labels and sequences. SSG is a meta-algorithm that leverages any probabilistic
learning method for label or sequence prediction, but employs a proper
regularization such that a new label or sequence is generated repeatedly until
the full set is produced. Though SSG is sequential in nature, it does not
penalize the ordering of the appearance of the set elements and can be applied
to a variety of set output problems, such as a set of classification labels or
sequences. We perform experiments with both benchmark and synthetic data sets
and demonstrate SSG's strong performance over baseline methods.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
"SoK - Security and Privacy in the Age of Drones: Threats, Challenges, Solution Mechanisms, and Scientific Gaps","Ben Nassi, Asaf Shabtai, Ryusuke Masuoka, Yuval Elovici","The evolution of drone technology in the past nine years since the first
commercial drone was introduced at CES 2010 has caused many individuals and
businesses to adopt drones for various purposes. We are currently living in an
era in which drones are being used for pizza delivery, the shipment of goods,
and filming, and they are likely to provide an alternative for transportation
in the near future. However, drones also pose a significant challenge in terms
of security and privacy within society (for both individuals and
organizations), and many drone related incidents are reported on a daily basis.
These incidents have called attention to the need to detect and disable drones
used for malicious purposes and opened up a new area of research and
development for academia and industry, with a market that is expected to reach
$1.85 billion by 2024. While some of the knowledge used to detect UAVs has been

academia alike to deal with the challenges associated with detecting the very
small and fast flying objects. In this paper, we describe new societal threats
to security and privacy created by drones, and present academic and industrial
methods used to detect and disable drones. We review methods targeted at areas
that restrict drone flights and analyze their effectiveness with regard to
various factors (e.g., weather, birds, ambient light, etc.). We present the
challenges arising in areas that allow drone flights, introduce the methods
that exist for dealing with these challenges, and discuss the scientific gaps
that exist in this area. Finally, we review methods used to disable drones,

A Path Planning Framework for a Flying Robot in Close Proximity of Humans,"Hyung-Jin Yoon, Christopher Widdowson, Thiago Marinho, Ranxiao Frances Wang, Naira Hovakimyan","We present a path planning framework that takes into account the human's
safety perception in the presence of a flying robot. The framework addresses
two objectives: (i) estimation of the uncertain parameters of the proposed
safety perception model based on test data collected using Virtual Reality (VR)
testbed, and (ii) offline optimal control computation using the estimated
safety perception model. Due to the unknown factors in the human tests data, it
is not suitable to use standard regression techniques that minimize the mean
squared error (MSE). We propose to use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) approach
where human's attention is considered as a hidden state to infer whether the
data samples are relevant to learn the safety perception model. The HMM
approach improved log-likelihood over the standard least squares solution. For
path planning, we use Bernstein polynomials for discretization, as the
resulting path remains within the convex hull of the control points, providing
guarantees for deconfliction with obstacles at low computational cost. An
example of optimal trajectory generation using the learned human model is
presented. The optimal trajectory generated using the proposed model results in
reasonable safety distance from the human. In contrast, the paths generated
using the standard regression model have undesirable shapes due to overfitting.
The example demonstrates that the HMM approach has robustness to the unknown
factors compared to the standard MSE model.",Robotics (cs.RO),,[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
Simple Physical Adversarial Examples against End-to-End Autonomous Driving Models,"Adith Boloor, Xin He, Christopher Gill, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Xuan Zhang","Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep
neural networks, are promoting a range of high-stakes applications, including
autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. While
deep learning for perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of
subtle adversarial manipulations of images, end-to-end demonstrations of
successful attacks, which manipulate the physical environment and result in
physical consequences, are scarce. Moreover, attacks typically involve
carefully constructed adversarial examples at the level of pixels. We
demonstrate the first end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation,
using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the
road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous
driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are
surprisingly easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in
which they are highly effective, and others that are less vulnerable (e.g.,
driving straight). Further, we use network deconvolution to demonstrate that
the attacks succeed by inducing activation patterns similar to entirely

An extended polygonal finite element method for large deformation fracture analysis,"Hai D. Huynh, Phuong Tran, Xiaoying Zhuang, H. Nguyen-Xuan","The modeling of large deformation fracture mechanics has been a challenging

in particular rubber ones. A crucial idea is to use a polygonal mesh to
represent space of the present numerical technique in advance, and then a local
refinement of structured meshes at the vicinity of the discontinuities is
additionally established. Due to differences in the size and type of elements
at the boundaries of those two regions, hanging nodes produced in the modified

Scaling Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Query Reformulation,"Pushpendre Rastogi, Arpit Gupta, Tongfei Chen, Lambert Mathias","We present a novel approach to dialogue state tracking and referring
expression resolution tasks. Successful contextual understanding of multi-turn
spoken dialogues requires resolving referring expressions across turns and
tracking the entities relevant to the conversation across turns. Tracking
conversational state is particularly challenging in a multi-domain scenario
when there exist multiple spoken language understanding (SLU) sub-systems, and
each SLU sub-system operates on its domain-specific meaning representation.
While previous approaches have addressed the disparate schema issue by learning
candidate transformations of the meaning representation, in this paper, we
instead model the reference resolution as a dialogue context-aware user query
reformulation task -- the dialog state is serialized to a sequence of natural
language tokens representing the conversation. We develop our model for query

Search-based 3D Planning and Trajectory Optimization for Safe Micro Aerial Vehicle Flight Under Sensor Visibility Constraints,"Matthias Nieuwenhuisen, Sven Behnke","Safe navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) requires not only
obstacle-free flight paths according to a static environment map, but also the
perception of and reaction to previously unknown and dynamic objects. This
implies that the onboard sensors cover the current flight direction. Due to the
limited payload of MAVs, full sensor coverage of the environment has to be
traded off with flight time. Thus, often only a part of the environment is
covered.
We present a combined allocentric complete planning and trajectory
optimization approach taking these sensor visibility constraints into account.
The optimized trajectories yield flight paths within the apex angle of a
Velodyne Puck Lite 3D laser scanner enabling low-level collision avoidance to
perceive obstacles in the flight direction. Furthermore, the optimized
trajectories take the flight dynamics into account and contain the velocities
and accelerations along the path.

On the Pitfalls of Measuring Emergent Communication,"Ryan Lowe, Jakob Foerster, Y-Lan Boureau, Joelle Pineau, Yann Dauphin","How do we know if communication is emerging in a multi-agent system? The vast
majority of recent papers on emergent communication show that adding a
communication channel leads to an increase in reward or task success. This is a
useful indicator, but provides only a coarse measure of the agent's learned
communication abilities. As we move towards more complex environments, it
becomes imperative to have a set of finer tools that allow qualitative and
quantitative insights into the emergence of communication. This may be
especially useful to allow humans to monitor agents' behaviour, whether for
fault detection, assessing performance, or even building trust. In this paper,
we examine a few intuitive existing metrics for measuring communication, and
show that they can be misleading. Specifically, by training deep reinforcement
learning agents to play simple matrix games augmented with a communication
channel, we find a scenario where agents appear to communicate (their messages
provide information about their subsequent action), and yet the messages do not
impact the environment or other agent in any way. We explain this phenomenon
using ablation studies and by visualizing the representations of the learned
policies. We also survey some commonly used metrics for measuring emergent
communication, and provide recommendations as to when these metrics should be
used.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
BenchPress: Analyzing Android App Vulnerability Benchmark Suites,"Joydeep Mitra, Venkatesh-Prasad Ranganath, Aditya Narkar","In recent years, various benchmark suites have been developed to evaluate the
efficacy of Android security analysis tools. The choice of such benchmark
suites used in tool evaluations is often based on the availability and
popularity of suites and not on their characteristics and relevance. One of the
reasons for such choices is the lack of information about the characteristics
and relevance of benchmarks suites.
In this context, we empirically evaluated four Android specific benchmark
suites: DroidBench, Ghera, IccBench, and UBCBench. For each benchmark suite, we
identified the APIs used by the suite that were discussed on Stack Overflow in
the context of Android app development and measured the usage of these APIs in
a sample of 227K real world apps (coverage). We also compared each pair of
benchmark suites to identify the differences between them in terms of API
usage. Finally, we identified security-related APIs used in real-world apps but
not in any of the above benchmark suites to assess the opportunities to extend
benchmark suites (gaps).
The findings in this paper can help 1) Android security analysis tool
developers choose benchmark suites that are best suited to evaluate their tools
(informed by coverage and pairwise comparison) and 2) Android app vulnerability
benchmark creators develop and extend benchmark suites (informed by gaps).",Software Engineering (cs.SE),; Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 19 Sep 2019 (this version, v4)]"

Exploiting Reuse in Pipeline-Aware Hyperparameter Tuning,"Liam Li, Evan Sparks, Kevin Jamieson, Ameet Talwalkar","Hyperparameter tuning of multi-stage pipelines introduces a significant
computational burden. Motivated by the observation that work can be reused
across pipelines if the intermediate computations are the same, we propose a
pipeline-aware approach to hyperparameter tuning. Our approach optimizes both
the design and execution of pipelines to maximize reuse. We design pipelines
amenable for reuse by (i) introducing a novel hybrid hyperparameter tuning
method called gridded random search, and (ii) reducing the average training
time in pipelines by adapting early-stopping hyperparameter tuning approaches.
We then realize the potential for reuse during execution by introducing a novel
caching problem for ML workloads which we pose as a mixed integer linear
program (ILP), and subsequently evaluating various caching heuristics relative
to the optimal solution of the ILP. We conduct experiments on simulated and
real-world machine learning pipelines to show that a pipeline-aware approach to

the existence of interesting non-trivial persistent first homology groups in

Learning Gaussian Policies from Corrective Human Feedback,"Daan Wout, Jan Scholten, Carlos Celemin, Jens Kober","Learning from human feedback is a viable alternative to control design that
does not require modelling or control expertise. Particularly, learning from
corrective advice garners advantages over evaluative feedback as it is a more
intuitive and scalable format. The current state-of-the-art in this field,
COACH, has proven to be a effective approach for confined problems. However, it
parameterizes the policy with Radial Basis Function networks, which require
meticulous feature space engineering for higher order systems. We introduce
Gaussian Process Coach (GPC), where feature space engineering is avoided by
employing Gaussian Processes. In addition, we use the available policy
uncertainty to 1) inquire feedback samples of maximal utility and 2) to adapt
the learning rate to the teacher's learning phase. We demonstrate that the

Confident Kernel Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning,"Babak Hosseini, Barbara Hammer","In recent years, kernel-based sparse coding (K-SRC) has received particular
attention due to its efficient representation of nonlinear data structures in
the feature space. Nevertheless, the existing K-SRC methods suffer from the
lack of consistency between their training and test optimization frameworks. In
this work, we propose a novel confident K-SRC and dictionary learning algorithm
(CKSC) which focuses on the discriminative reconstruction of the data based on
its representation in the kernel space. CKSC focuses on reconstructing each
data sample via weighted contributions which are confident in its corresponding
class of data. We employ novel discriminative terms to apply this scheme to
both training and test frameworks in our algorithm. This specific design
increases the consistency of these optimization frameworks and improves the
discriminative performance in the recall phase. In addition, CKSC directly
employs the supervised information in its dictionary learning framework to
enhance the discriminative structure of the dictionary. For empirical
evaluations, we implement our CKSC algorithm on multivariate time-series
benchmarks such as DynTex++ and UTKinect. Our claims regarding the superior
performance of the proposed algorithm are justified throughout comparing its
classification results to the state-of-the-art K-SRC algorithms.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]

Bootstrapping Method for Developing Part-of-Speech Tagged Corpus in Low Resource Languages Tagset - A Focus on an African Igbo,"Onyenwe Ikechukwu E, Onyedinma Ebele G, Aniegwu Godwin E, Ezeani Ignatius M","Most languages, especially in Africa, have fewer or no established
part-of-speech (POS) tagged corpus. However, POS tagged corpus is essential for
natural language processing (NLP) to support advanced researches such as
machine translation, speech recognition, etc. Even in cases where there is no
POS tagged corpus, there are some languages for which parallel texts are
available online. The task of POS tagging a new language corpus with a new
tagset usually face a bootstrapping problem at the initial stages of the
annotation process. The unavailability of automatic taggers to help the human
annotator makes the annotation process to appear infeasible to quickly produce
adequate amounts of POS tagged corpus for advanced NLP research and training
the taggers. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of a POS annotation
method that employed the services of two automatic approaches to assist POS
tagged corpus creation for a novel language in NLP. The two approaches are
cross-lingual and monolingual POS tags projection. We used cross-lingual to
automatically create an initial 'errorful' tagged corpus for a target language
via word-alignment. The resources for creating this are derived from a source
language rich in NLP resources. A monolingual method is applied to clean the
induce noise via an alignment process and to transform the source language tags
to the target language tags. We used English and Igbo as our case study. This
is possible because there are parallel texts that exist between English and
Igbo, and the source language English has available NLP resources. The results
of the experiment show a steady improvement in accuracy and rate of tags
transformation with score ranges of 6.13% to 83.79% and 8.67% to 98.37%

Existing (non-distributed) algorithms focus on minimizing computation by
pruning the search space of possible dependencies. However, distributed

TACAN: Transmitter Authentication through Covert Channels in Controller Area Networks,"Xuhang Ying, Giuseppe Bernieri, Mauro Conti, Radha Poovendran","Nowadays, the interconnection of automotive systems with modern digital
devices offers advanced user experiences to drivers. Electronic Control Units
(ECUs) carry out a multitude of operations using the insecure Controller Area
Network (CAN) bus in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Therefore,
dangerous attacks, such as disabling brakes, are possible and the safety of
passengers is at risk. In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter
Authentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs by
exploiting the covert channels without introducing CAN protocol modifications
or traffic overheads (i.e., no extra bits or messages are used). TACAN turns
upside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it
to build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter
authentication via a trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different
covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based,
leveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) offset-based, exploiting the clock
offsets of CAN messages; 3) Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing
authentication messages into the LSBs of normal CAN data. We implement the
covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR testbed and
evaluate their performance through extensive experiments. We demonstrate the
feasibility of TACAN, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the
regular functionality of ECUs. In particular, the bit error ratios are within
0.1% and 0.42% for the IAT-based and offset-based covert channels,
respectively. Furthermore, the bit error ratio of the LSB-based covert channel
is equal to that of a normal CAN bus, which is 3.1x10^-7%.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),,[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
A Visually Plausible Grasping System for Object Manipulation and Interaction in Virtual Reality Environments,"Sergiu Oprea, Pablo Martinez-Gonzalez, Alberto Garcia-Garcia, John Alejandro Castro-Vargas, Sergio Orts-Escolano, Jose Garcia-Rodriguez","Interaction in virtual reality (VR) environments is essential to achieve a
pleasant and immersive experience. Most of the currently existing VR
applications, lack of robust object grasping and manipulation, which are the
cornerstone of interactive systems. Therefore, we propose a realistic, flexible
and robust grasping system that enables rich and real-time interactions in
virtual environments. It is visually realistic because it is completely
user-controlled, flexible because it can be used for different hand
configurations, and robust because it allows the manipulation of objects
regardless their geometry, i.e. hand is automatically fitted to the object
shape. In order to validate our proposal, an exhaustive qualitative and
quantitative performance analysis has been carried out. On the one hand,
qualitative evaluation was used in the assessment of the abstract aspects such
as: hand movement realism, interaction realism and motor control. On the other
hand, for the quantitative evaluation a novel error metric has been proposed to
visually analyze the performed grips. This metric is based on the computation
of the distance from the finger phalanges to the nearest contact point on the
object surface. These contact points can be used with different application
purposes, mainly in the field of robotics. As a conclusion, system evaluation

Non-Negative Local Sparse Coding for Subspace Clustering,"Babak Hosseini, Barbara Hammer","Subspace sparse coding (SSC) algorithms have proven to be beneficial to
clustering problems. They provide an alternative data representation in which
the underlying structure of the clusters can be better captured. However, most
of the research in this area is mainly focused on enhancing the sparse coding
part of the problem. In contrast, we introduce a novel objective term in our
proposed SSC framework which focuses on the separability of data points in the
coding space. We also provide mathematical insights into how this
local-separability term improves the clustering result of the SSC framework.
Our proposed non-linear local SSC algorithm (NLSSC) also benefits from the
efficient choice of its sparsity terms and constraints. The NLSSC algorithm is
also formulated in the kernel-based framework (NLKSSC) which can represent the
nonlinear structure of data. In addition, we address the possibility of having
redundancies in sparse coding results and its negative effect on graph-based
clustering problems. We introduce the link-restore post-processing step to
improve the representation graph of non-negative SSC algorithms such as ours.
Empirical evaluations on well-known clustering benchmarks show that our
proposed NLSSC framework results in better clusterings compared to the

Learning Feature Aggregation in Temporal Domain for Re-Identification,"Jakub Špaňhel, Jakub Sochor, Roman Juránek, Petr Dobeš, Vojtěch Bartl, Adam Herout","Person re-identification is a standard and established problem in the
computer vision community. In recent years, vehicle re-identification is also

a method for aggregation of features in temporal domain as it is common to have
multiple observations of the same object. The aggregation is based on weighting
different elements of the feature vectors by different weights and it is
trained in an end-to-end manner by a Siamese network. The experimental results
show that our method outperforms other existing methods for feature aggregation
in temporal domain on both vehicle and person re-identification tasks.
Furthermore, to push research in vehicle re-identification further, we
introduce a novel dataset CarsReId74k. The dataset is not limited to

Learning Resolution Parameters for Graph Clustering,"Nate Veldt, David F. Gleich, Anthony Wirth","Finding clusters of well-connected nodes in a graph is an extensively studied
problem in graph-based data analysis. Because of its many applications, a large
number of distinct graph clustering objective functions and algorithms have
already been proposed and analyzed. To aid practitioners in determining the
best clustering approach to use in different applications, we present new
techniques for automatically learning how to set clustering resolution
parameters. These parameters control the size and structure of communities that
are formed by optimizing a generalized objective function. We begin by
formalizing the notion of a parameter fitness function, which measures how well
a fixed input clustering approximately solves a generalized clustering
objective for a specific resolution parameter value. Under reasonable
assumptions, which suit two key graph clustering applications, such a parameter
fitness function can be efficiently minimized using a bisection-like method,
yielding a resolution parameter that fits well with the example clustering. We
view our framework as a type of single-shot hyperparameter tuning, as we are
able to learn a good resolution parameter with just a single example. Our
general approach can be applied to learn resolution parameters for both local
and global graph clustering objectives. We demonstrate its utility in several
experiments on real-world data where it is helpful to learn resolution
parameters from a given example clustering.",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]
"Situational Awareness, Drivers Trust in Automated Driving Systems and Secondary Task Performance","Luke Petersen, Lionel Robert, X. Jessie Yang, Dawn M. Tilbury","Driver assistance systems, also called automated driving systems, allow
drivers to immerse themselves in non-driving-related tasks. Unfortunately,
drivers may not trust the automated driving system, which prevents either
handing over the driving task or fully focusing on the secondary task. We
assert that enhancing situational awareness can increase trust in automation.
Situational awareness should increase trust and lead to better secondary task
performance. This study manipulated situational awareness by providing them
with different types of information: the control condition provided no
information to the driver, the low condition provided a status update, while
the high condition provided a status update and a suggested course of action.
Data collected included measures of trust, trusting behavior, and task
performance through surveys, eye-tracking, and heart rate data. Results show
that situational awareness both promoted and moderated the impact of trust in
the automated vehicle, leading to better secondary task performance. This

Zero-Shot Autonomous Vehicle Policy Transfer: From Simulation to Real-World via Adversarial Learning,"Behdad Chalaki, Logan E. Beaver, Ben Remer, Kathy Jang, Eugene Vinitsky, Alexandre M. Bayen, Andreas A. Malikopoulos","In this article, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer of an autonomous driving

coordinate with each other while crossing a roundabout in the presence of an
adversary in simulation. The adversarial policy successfully reproduces the
simulated behavior and incidentally outperforms, in terms of travel time, both

Near-Optimal Algorithms for Shortest Paths in Weighted Unit-Disk Graphs,"Haitao Wang, Jie Xue","We revisit a classical graph-theoretic problem, the \textit{single-source
shortest-path} (SSSP) problem, in weighted unit-disk graphs. We first propose
an exact (and deterministic) algorithm which solves the problem in $O(n \log^2
n)$ time using linear space, where $n$ is the number of the vertices of the
graph. This significantly improves the previous deterministic algorithm by
Cabello and Jejčič [CGTA'15] which uses $O(n^{1+\delta})$ time and
$O(n^{1+\delta})$ space (for any small constant $\delta>0$) and the previous
randomized algorithm by Kaplan et al. [SODA'17] which uses $O(n \log^{12+o(1)}
n)$ expected time and $O(n \log^3 n)$ space. More specifically, we show that if
the 2D offline insertion-only (additively-)weighted nearest-neighbor problem
with $k$ operations (i.e., insertions and queries) can be solved in $f(k)$
time, then the SSSP problem in weighted unit-disk graphs can be solved in $O(n
\log n+f(n))$ time. Using the same framework with some new ideas, we also
obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm for the problem, using $O(n
\log n + n \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ time and linear space. This improves the
previous $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm by Chan and Skrepetos
[SoCG'18] which uses $O((1/\varepsilon)^2 n \log n)$ time and
$O((1/\varepsilon)^2 n)$ space. More specifically, we show that if the 2D
offline insertion-only weighted nearest-neighbor problem with $k_1$ operations
in which at most $k_2$ operations are insertions can be solved in $f(k_1,k_2)$
time, then the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate SSSP problem in weighted unit-disk
graphs can be solved in $O(n \log n+f(n,O(\varepsilon^{-2})))$ time. Because of
the $\Omega(n \log n)$-time lower bound of the problem (even when approximation
is allowed), both of our algorithms are almost optimal.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),; Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019]

grading in rare cancers is difficult and largely undefined because of small
sample sizes, the sheer volume of time needed to undertake on such a task, and
the inherent difficulty of extracting human-observed patterns. One of the most
challenging examples is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a primary liver
cancer arising from the biliary system, for which there is well-recognized
tumor heterogeneity and no grading paradigm or prognostic biomarkers. In this
paper, we propose a new unsupervised deep convolutional autoencoder-based
clustering model that groups together cellular and structural morphologies of
tumor in 246 ICC digitized whole slides, based on visual similarity. From this
visual dictionary of histologic patterns, we use the clusters as covariates to
train Cox-proportional hazard survival models. In univariate analysis, three
clusters were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival.
Combinations of these clusters were significant in multivariate analysis. In a
multivariate analysis of all clusters, five showed significance to
recurrence-free survival, however the overall model was not measured to be
significant. Finally, a pathologist assigned clinical terminology to the
significant clusters in the visual dictionary and found evidence supporting the
hypothesis that collagen-enriched fibrosis plays a role in disease severity.

from the hidden feature vectors via different projection matrices and
non-linear activation function. The high rank projection layer is able to
improve the expressiveness of LSTM-CTC models. The experimental results show

Correct-by-construction control synthesis for buck converters with event-triggered state measurement,"Liren Yang, Xiaofan Cui, Al-Thaddeus Avestruz, Necmiye Ozay","In this paper, we illustrate a new correct-by-construction switching
controller for a power converter with event-triggered measurements. The
event-triggered measurement scheme is beneficial for high frequency power
converters because it requires relatively low-speed sampling hardware and is
immune to unmodeled switching transients. While providing guarantees on the
closed-loop system behavior is crucial in this application, off-the-shelf
abstraction-based techniques cannot be directly employed to synthesize a
controller in this setting because controller cannot always get instantaneous
access to the current state. As a result, the switching action has to be based
on slightly out-of-date measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce
the out-of-date measurement as an extra state variable and project out the
inaccessible real state to construct a belief space abstraction. The properties
preserved by this belief space abstraction are analyzed. Finally, an

All You Need is a Few Shifts: Designing Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification,"Weijie Chen, Di Xie, Yuan Zhang, Shiliang Pu","Shift operation is an efficient alternative over depthwise separable
convolution. However, it is still bottlenecked by its implementation manner,
namely memory movement. To put this direction forward, a new and novel basic
component named Sparse Shift Layer (SSL) is introduced in this paper to
construct efficient convolutional neural networks. In this family of
architectures, the basic block is only composed by 1x1 convolutional layers
with only a few shift operations applied to the intermediate feature maps. To
make this idea feasible, we introduce shift operation penalty during
optimization and further propose a quantization-aware shift learning method to
impose the learned displacement more friendly for inference. Extensive ablation
studies indicate that only a few shift operations are sufficient to provide
spatial information communication. Furthermore, to maximize the role of SSL, we
redesign an improved network architecture to Fully Exploit the limited capacity
of neural Network (FE-Net). Equipped with SSL, this network can achieve 75.0%
top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 563M M-Adds. It surpasses other

Zero-shot Domain Adaptation Based on Attribute Information,"Masato Ishii, Takashi Takenouchi, Masashi Sugiyama","In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation method that can be
applied without target data. We consider the situation where domain shift is
caused by a prior change of a specific factor and assume that we know how the
prior changes between source and target domains. We call this factor an
attribute, and reformulate the domain adaptation problem to utilize the
attribute prior instead of target data. In our method, the source data are
reweighted with the sample-wise weight estimated by the attribute prior and the
data themselves so that they are useful in the target domain. We theoretically
reveal that our method provides more precise estimation of sample-wise
transferability than a straightforward attribute-based reweighting approach.
Experimental results with both toy datasets and benchmark datasets show that
our method can perform well, though it does not use any target data.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
DeepCount: Crowd Counting with WiFi via Deep Learning,"Shangqing Liu, Yanchao Zhao, Fanggang Xue, Bing Chen, Xiang Chen","Recently, the research of wireless sensing has achieved more intelligent

the environment in which a single person exists. In order to solve the problem

solution to achieve crowd counting (inferred population) using deep learning in
a closed environment with WIFI signals - DeepCout, which is the first in a
multi-human environment. step. Since the use of WiFi to directly count the

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to automatically extract the relationship
between the number of people and the channel, and use Long Short Term

to correct the deep learning model in the fine-tune stage, which, in turn,
reduces the required training data and make our method evolving over time. The
system of DeepCount is performed and evaluated on the commercial WiFi devices.

SymPas: Symbolic Program Slicing,Yingzhou Zhang,"Program slicing is a technique for simplifying programs by focusing on
selected aspects of their behaviour. Current mainstream static slicing methods
operate on the PDG (program dependence graph) or SDG (system dependence graph),
but these friendly graph representations may be expensive and error-prone for
some users. We attempt in this paper to study a light-weight approach of static
program slicing, called Symbolic Program Slicing (SymPas), which works as a
dataflow analysis on LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine). In our SymPas approach,
slices are stored symbolically rather than procedure being re-analysed (cf.
procedure summaries). Instead of re-analysing a procedure multiple times to
find its slices for each callling context, SymPas calculates a single symbolic
(or parameterized) slice which can be instantiated at call sites avoiding
re-analysis; it is implemented in LLVM to perform slicing on its intermediate
representation (IR). For comparison, we systematically adapt IFDS
(Interprocedural Finite Distributive Subset) analysis and the SDG-based slicing
method (SDG-IFDS) to statically IR slice programs. Evaluated on open-source and
benchmark programs, our backward SymPas shows a factor-of-6 reduction in time
cost and a factor-of-4 reduction in space cost, compared to backward SDG-IFDS,
thus being more efficient. In addition, the result shows that after studying
slices from 66 programs, ranging up to 336,800 IR instructions in size, SymPas

A Sliding Mode Force and Position Controller Synthesis for Series Elastic Actuators,"Emre Sariyildiz, Rahim Mutlu, Haoyong Yu","This paper deals with the robust force and position control problems of
Series Elastic Actuators. It is shown that a Series Elastic Actuator's force
control problem can be described by a second-order dynamic model which suffers
from only matched disturbances. However, the position control dynamics of a
Series Elastic Actuator is of fourth-order and includes matched and mismatched
disturbances. In other words, a Series Elastic Actuator's position control is
more complicated than its force control, particularly when disturbances are
considered. A novel robust motion controller is proposed for Series Elastic
Actuators by using Disturbance Observer and Sliding Mode Control. When the
proposed robust motion controller is implemented, a Series Elastic Actuator can
precisely track desired trajectories and safely contact with an unknown and
dynamic environment. The proposed motion controller does not require precise

uncertainty propagates non-linearly over time depending on system dynamics.
Next, we define the value of a new update of the process of interest as a
function of AoI and system parameters of the NCSs. We use the aggregated update

CIA-Net: Robust Nuclei Instance Segmentation with Contour-aware Information Aggregation,"Yanning Zhou, Omer Fahri Onder, Qi Dou, Efstratios Tsougenis, Hao Chen, Pheng-Ann Heng","Accurate segmenting nuclei instances is a crucial step in computer-aided
image analysis to extract rich features for cellular estimation and following
diagnosis as well as treatment. While it still remains challenging because the
wide existence of nuclei clusters, along with the large morphological variances
among different organs make nuclei instance segmentation susceptible to
over-/under-segmentation. Additionally, the inevitably subjective annotating
and mislabeling prevent the network learning from reliable samples and
eventually reduce the generalization capability for robustly segmenting unseen
organ nuclei. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep neural network,
namely Contour-aware Informative Aggregation Network (CIA-Net) with multi-level
information aggregation module between two task-specific decoders. Rather than
independent decoders, it leverages the merit of spatial and texture
dependencies between nuclei and contour by bi-directionally aggregating
task-specific features. Furthermore, we proposed a novel smooth truncated loss
that modulates losses to reduce the perturbation from outliers. Consequently,
the network can focus on learning from reliable and informative samples, which
inherently improves the generalization capability. Experiments on the 2018

Face Liveness Detection Based on Client Identity Using Siamese Network,"Huiling Hao, Mingtao Pei","Face liveness detection is an essential prerequisite for face recognition

recognition instead of before face recognition, that is, we detect face
liveness with the client identity information. We train a Siamese network with
image pairs. Each image pair consists of two real face images or one real and
one fake face images. The face images in each pair come from a same client.
Given a test face image, the face image is firstly recognized by face

Personal Dynamic Cost-Aware Sensing for Latent Context Detection,"Saar Tal, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach","In the past decade, the usage of mobile devices has gone far beyond simple
activities like calling and texting. Today, smartphones contain multiple
embedded sensors and are able to collect useful sensing data about the user and

method dynamically determines user's sensors sampling policy based on three
factors: (1) User's last known context; (2) Predicted information loss using

minimizing both sampling cost and information loss. The method is based on
various machine learning techniques including autoencoder neural networks for

whenever $ \eta_{ij}^{\{l\}}=-1$, for $ 1\leq l \leq k(G) $, then
$d_{G}(i,j)=2^{l}$ , where $d_{G}(i,j)$ is the shortest path distance between $

Online Budgeted Learning for Classifier Induction,"Eran Fainman, Bracha Shapira, Lior Rokach, Yisroel Mirsky","In real-world machine learning applications, there is a cost associated with
sampling of different features. Budgeted learning can be used to select which
feature-values to acquire from each instance in a dataset, such that the best

possible in the domain of online learning since one may not retroactively
acquire feature-values from past instances. In online learning, the challenge
is to find the optimum set of features to be acquired from each instance upon
arrival from a data stream. In this paper we introduce the issue of online
budgeted learning and describe a general framework for addressing this
challenge. We propose two types of feature value acquisition policies based on
the multi-armed bandit problem: random and adaptive. Adaptive policies perform
online adjustments according to new information coming from a data stream,
while random policies are not sensitive to the information that arrives from
the data stream. Our comparative study on five real-world datasets indicates

We apply the theory to multi-sensor fusion for navigation, when all the sensors

typically occurs in GPS-denied environments. In the context of Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM), Monte-Carlo runs and comparisons to OC-EKF,

Automated Construction of Metric Maps using a Stochastic Robotic Swarm Leveraging Received Signal Strength,"Ragesh K. Ramachandran, Spring Berman","In this work, we present a novel automated procedure for constructing a
metric map of an unknown domain with obstacles using uncertain position data
collected by a swarm of resource-constrained robots. The robots obtain this
data during random exploration of the domain by combining onboard odometry
information with noisy measurements of signals received from transmitters
located outside the domain. This data is processed offline to compute a density
function of the free space over a discretization of the domain. We use
persistent homology techniques from topological data analysis to estimate a
value for thresholding the density function, thereby segmenting the
obstacle-occupied region in the unknown domain. Our approach is substantiated
with theoretical results to prove its completeness and to analyze its time
complexity. The effectiveness of the procedure is illustrated with numerical
simulations conducted on six different domains, each with two signal
transmitters.",Robotics (cs.RO),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
The Emergence of Software Diversity in Maven Central,"César Soto-Valero, Amine Benelallam, Nicolas Harrand, Olivier Barais, Benoit Baudry","Maven artifacts are immutable: an artifact that is uploaded on Maven Central
cannot be removed nor modified. The only way for developers to upgrade their
library is to release a new version. Consequently, Maven Central accumulates
all the versions of all the libraries that are published there, and
applications that declare a dependency towards a library can pick any version.
In this work, we hypothesize that the immutability of Maven artifacts and the
ability to choose any version naturally support the emergence of software
diversity within Maven Central. We analyze 1,487,956 artifacts that represent
all the versions of 73,653 libraries. We observe that more than 30% of
libraries have multiple versions that are actively used by latest artifacts. In
the case of popular libraries, more than 50% of their versions are used. We
also observe that more than 17% of libraries have several versions that are
significantly more used than the other versions. Our results indicate that the
immutability of artifacts in Maven Central does support a sustained level of
diversity among versions of libraries in the repository.",Software Engineering (cs.SE),,"[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 14 Mar 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Sub-event detection from Twitter streams as a sequence labeling problem,"Giannis Bekoulis, Johannes Deleu, Thomas Demeester, Chris Develder","This paper introduces improved methods for sub-event detection in social
media streams, by applying neural sequence models not only on the level of
individual posts, but also directly on the stream level. Current approaches to
identify sub-events within a given event, such as a goal during a soccer match,
essentially do not exploit the sequential nature of social media streams. We
address this shortcoming by framing the sub-event detection problem in social
media streams as a sequence labeling task and adopt a neural sequence
architecture that explicitly accounts for the chronological order of posts.
Specifically, we (i) establish a neural baseline that outperforms a graph-based
state-of-the-art method for binary sub-event detection (2.7% micro-F1
improvement), as well as (ii) demonstrate superiority of a recurrent neural
network model on the posts sequence level for labeled sub-events (2.4%
bin-level F1 improvement over non-sequential models).",Computation and Language (cs.CL),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]

Depth Coefficients for Depth Completion,"Saif Imran, Yunfei Long, Xiaoming Liu, Daniel Morris","Depth completion involves estimating a dense depth image from sparse depth
measurements, often guided by a color image. While linear upsampling is
straight forward, it results in artifacts including depth pixels being
interpolated in empty space across discontinuities between objects. Current
methods use deep networks to upsample and ""complete"" the missing depth pixels.
Nevertheless, depth smearing between objects remains a challenge. We propose a
new representation for depth called Depth Coefficients (DC) to address this
problem. It enables convolutions to more easily avoid inter-object depth
mixing. We also show that the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
can promote depth mixing, and thus propose instead to use cross-entropy loss
for DC. With quantitative and qualitative evaluation on benchmarks, we show
that switching out sparse depth input and MSE loss with our DC representation
and cross-entropy loss is a simple way to improve depth completion performance,
and reduce pixel depth mixing, which leads to improved depth-based object
detection.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]

Resource Abstraction for Reinforcement Learning in Multiagent Congestion Problems,"Kleanthis Malialis, Sam Devlin, Daniel Kudenko","Real-world congestion problems (e.g. traffic congestion) are typically very
complex and large-scale. Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
promising candidate for dealing with this emerging complexity by providing an
autonomous and distributed solution to these problems. However, there are three
limiting factors that affect the deployability of MARL approaches to congestion
problems. These are learning time, scalability and decentralised coordination
i.e. no communication between the learning agents. In this paper we introduce
Resource Abstraction, an approach that addresses these challenges by allocating
the available resources into abstract groups. This abstraction creates new
reward functions that provide a more informative signal to the learning agents
and aid the coordination amongst them. Experimental work is conducted on two
benchmark domains from the literature, an abstract congestion problem and a
realistic traffic congestion problem. The current state-of-the-art for solving
multiagent congestion problems is a form of reward shaping called difference
rewards. We show that the system using Resource Abstraction significantly
improves the learning speed and scalability, and achieves the highest possible
or near-highest joint performance/social welfare for both congestion problems
in large-scale scenarios involving up to 1000 reinforcement learning agents.",Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Is the Stack Distance Between Test Case and Method Correlated With Test Effectiveness?,"Rainer Niedermayr, Stefan Wagner","Mutation testing is a means to assess the effectiveness of a test suite and
its outcome is considered more meaningful than code coverage metrics. However,
despite several optimizations, mutation testing requires a significant
computational effort and has not been widely adopted in industry. Therefore, we
study in this paper whether test effectiveness can be approximated using a more
light-weight approach. We hypothesize that a test case is more likely to detect
faults in methods that are close to the test case on the call stack than in
methods that the test case accesses indirectly through many other methods.
Based on this hypothesis, we propose the minimal stack distance between test
case and method as a new test measure, which expresses how close any test case
comes to a given method, and study its correlation with test effectiveness. We
conducted an empirical study with 21 open-source projects, which comprise in
total 1.8 million LOC, and show that a correlation exists between stack
distance and test effectiveness. The correlation reaches a strength up to 0.58.
We further show that a classifier using the minimal stack distance along with
additional easily computable measures can predict the mutation testing result
of a method with 92.9% precision and 93.4% recall. Hence, such a classifier can
be taken into consideration as a light-weight alternative to mutation testing
or as a preceding, less costly step to that.",Software Engineering (cs.SE),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Visual Semantic Information Pursuit: A Survey,"Daqi Liu, Miroslaw Bober, Josef Kittler","Visual semantic information comprises two important parts: the meaning of
each visual semantic unit and the coherent visual semantic relation conveyed by
these visual semantic units. Essentially, the former one is a visual perception
task while the latter one corresponds to visual context reasoning. Remarkable
advances in visual perception have been achieved due to the success of deep
learning. In contrast, visual semantic information pursuit, a visual scene
semantic interpretation task combining visual perception and visual context
reasoning, is still in its early stage. It is the core task of many different
computer vision applications, such as object detection, visual semantic
segmentation, visual relationship detection or scene graph generation. Since it
helps to enhance the accuracy and the consistency of the resulting
interpretation, visual context reasoning is often incorporated with visual
perception in current deep end-to-end visual semantic information pursuit
methods. However, a comprehensive review for this exciting area is still
lacking. In this survey, we present a unified theoretical paradigm for all
these methods, followed by an overview of the major developments and the future

Node Centrality Metrics for Hotspots Analysis in Telecom Big Data,"Emil Mededovic, Vaggelis G. Douros, Petri Mähönen","In this work, we are interested in the applications of big data in the
telecommunication domain, analysing two weeks of datasets provided by Telecom
Italia for Milan and Trento. Our objective is to identify hotspots which are
places with very high communication traffic relative to others and measure the
interaction between them. We model the hotspots as nodes in a graph and then
apply node centrality metrics that quantify the importance of each node. We
review five node centrality metrics and show that they can be divided into two
families: the first family is composed of closeness and betweenness centrality
whereas the second family consists of degree, PageRank and eigenvector
centrality. We then proceed with a statistical analysis in order to evaluate
the consistency of the results over the two weeks. We find out that the ranking
of the hotspots under the various centrality metrics remains practically the
same with the time for both Milan and Trento. We further identify that the
relative difference of the values of the metrics is smaller for PageRank
centrality than for closeness centrality and this holds for both Milan and
Trento. Finally, our analysis reveals that the variance of the results is
significantly smaller for Trento than for Milan.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Secure and efficient compressed sensing based encryption with sparse matrices,"Wonwoo Cho, Nam Yul Yu","In this paper, we study the security of a compressed sensing (CS) based
cryptosystem called a sparse one-time sensing (S-OTS) cryptosystem, which
encrypts a plaintext with a sparse measurement matrix. To construct the secret
matrix and renew it at each encryption, a bipolar keystream and a random
permutation pattern are employed as cryptographic primitives, which can be
obtained by a keystream generator of stream ciphers. With a small number of
nonzero elements in the measurement matrix, the S-OTS cryptosystem achieves
efficient CS encryption in terms of memory and computational cost. In security
analysis, we show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be indistinguishable as long
as each plaintext has constant energy, which formalizes computational security
against ciphertext only attacks (COA). In addition, we consider a chosen
plaintext attack (CPA) against the S-OTS cryptosystem, which consists of two
sequential stages, keystream and key recovery attacks. Against keystream
recovery under CPA, we demonstrate that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be secure
with overwhelmingly high probability, as an adversary needs to distinguish a
prohibitively large number of candidate keystreams. Finally, we conduct an
information-theoretic analysis to show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be
resistant against key recovery under CPA by guaranteeing that the probability
of success is extremely low. In conclusion, the S-OTS cryptosystem can be
computationally secure against COA and the two-stage CPA, while providing
efficiency in CS encryption.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,"[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 5 Nov 2019 (this version, v6)]"

CIMAX: Collective Information Maximization in Robotic Swarms Using Local Communication,"Hannes Hornischer, Joshua Cherian Varughese, Ronald Thenius, Franz Wotawa, Manfred Füllsack, Thomas Schmickl","Robotic swarms and mobile sensor networks are used for environmental
monitoring in various domains and areas of operation. Especially in otherwise
inaccessible environments decentralized robotic swarms can be advantageous due
to their high spatial resolution of measurements and resilience to failure of
individuals in the swarm. However, such robotic swarms might need to be able to
compensate misplacement during deployment or adapt to dynamical changes in the
environment. Reaching a collective decision in a swarm with limited
communication abilities without a central entity serving as decision-maker can
be a challenging task. Here we present the CIMAX algorithm for collective
decision making for maximizing the information gathered by the swarm as a
whole. Agents negotiate based on their individual sensor readings and
ultimately make a decision for collectively moving in a particular direction so
that the swarm as a whole increases the amount of relevant measurements and
thus accessible information. We use both simulation and real robotic
experiments for presenting, testing and validating our algorithm. CIMAX is

Animating an Autonomous 3D Talking Avatar,"Dominik Borer, Dominik Lutz, Martin Guay","One of the main challenges with embodying a conversational agent is
annotating how and when motions can be played and composed together in
real-time, without any visual artifact. The inherent problem is to do so---for
a large amount of motions---without introducing mistakes in the annotation. To
our knowledge, there is no automatic method that can process animations and
automatically label actions and compatibility between them. In practice, a
state machine, where clips are the actions, is created manually by setting
connections between the states with the timing parameters for these
connections. Authoring this state machine for a large amount of motions leads
to a visual overflow, and increases the amount of possible mistakes. In
consequence, conversational agent embodiments are left with little variations
and quickly become repetitive. In this paper, we address this problem with a
compact taxonomy of chit chat behaviors, that we can utilize to simplify and
partially automate the graph authoring process. We measured the time required
to label actions of an embodiment using our simple interface, compared to the
standard state machine interface in Unreal Engine, and found that our approach
is 7 times faster. We believe that our labeling approach could be a path to
automated labeling: once a sub-set of motions are labeled (using our
interface), we could learn a prediction that could attribute a label to new
clips---allowing to really scale up virtual agent embodiments.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Towards Accurate Camera Geopositioning by Image Matching,"Raffaele Imbriaco, Clint Sebastian, Egor Bondarev, Peter de With","In this work, we present a camera geopositioning system based on matching a

positioning and computation time. We refine the obtained position from the
query image using a new outlier removal algorithm. The matching of the query
image is obtained with a recall@5 larger than 90% for panorama-to-panorama
matching. We cluster available panoramas from geographically adjacent locations

Big Data Goes Small: Real-Time Spectrum-Driven Embedded Wireless Networking Through Deep Learning in the RF Loop,"Francesco Restuccia, Tommaso Melodia","The explosion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things will result in an
exceptionally crowded RF environment, where techniques such as spectrum sharing
and dynamic spectrum access will become essential components of the wireless
communication process. In this vision, wireless devices must be able to (i)
learn to autonomously extract knowledge from the spectrum on-the-fly; and (ii)
react in real time to the inferred spectrum knowledge by appropriately changing
communication parameters, including frequency band, symbol modulation, coding
rate, among others. Traditional CPU-based machine learning suffers from high
latency, and requires application-specific and computationally-intensive
feature extraction/selection algorithms. In this paper, we present RFLearn, the
first system enabling spectrum knowledge extraction from unprocessed I/Q
samples by deep learning directly in the RF loop. RFLearn provides (i) a
complete hardware/software architecture where the CPU, radio transceiver and
learning/actuation circuits are tightly connected for maximum performance; and
(ii) a learning circuit design framework where the latency vs. hardware

performance of RFLearn on custom software-defined radio built on a

Wikipedia running on our local testbed, we perform a set of experiments to
quantify the influence of DVFS, vertical and horizontal scaling, and CPU
pinning on end-to-end response time (average and tail), throughput, and power
consumption with different workloads. Results of the experiments show that DVFS
rarely reduces the power consumption of underloaded servers by more than 5%,
but it can be used to limit the maximal power consumption of a saturated server
by up to 20% (at a cost of performance degradation). CPU pinning reduces the
power consumption of underloaded server (by up to 7%) at the cost of
performance degradation, which can be limited by choosing an appropriate CPU
pinning scheme. Horizontal and vertical scaling improves both the average and
tail response time, but the improvement is not proportional to the amount of

response time of horizontally scaled applications.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Impacts of Grid Structure on PLL-Synchronization Stability of Converter-Integrated Power Systems,"Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Wei Dong, Florian Dörfler","Small-signal instability of grid-connected power converters may arise when
the converters use a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with a weak grid.
Commonly, this stability problem (referred as PLL-synchronization stability in

infinite bus, which however, omits the impacts of power grid structure and the
interactions among multiple converters. Motivated by this, we investigate how
the grid structure affects PLL-synchronization stability of multi-converter
systems. By using Kron reduction to eliminate the interior nodes, an equivalent
reduced network is obtained which contains only the converter nodes. We
explicitly show how the Kron-reduced multi-converter system can be decoupled
into its modes. This modal representation allows us to demonstrate that the
smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix of the Kron-reduced
network dominates the stability margin. We also carry out a sensitivity
analysis of this smallest eigenvalue to explore how a perturbation in the
original network affects the stability margin. On this basis, we provide
guidelines on how to improve the PLL-synchronization stability of

Improving Transparency of Deep Neural Inference Process,"Hiroshi Kuwajima, Masayuki Tanaka, Masatoshi Okutomi","Deep learning techniques are rapidly advanced recently, and becoming a

feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, 2)
linguistic feature analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing
the visual attributes for each feature contributing to inference process, and
3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among input data, inference

Hardness-Aware Deep Metric Learning,"Wenzhao Zheng, Zhaodong Chen, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou","This paper presents a hardness-aware deep metric learning (HDML) framework.
Most previous deep metric learning methods employ the hard negative mining

this mining strategy only utilizes a subset of training data, which may not be

comprehensively. To address this problem, we perform linear interpolation on
embeddings to adaptively manipulate their hard levels and generate
corresponding label-preserving synthetics for recycled training, so that

Compact Representation of Value Function in Partially Observable Stochastic Games,"Karel Horák, Branislav Bošanský, Christopher Kiekintveld, Charles Kamhoua","Value methods for solving stochastic games with partial observability model
the uncertainty about states of the game as a probability distribution over
possible states. The dimension of this belief space is the number of states.
For many practical problems, for example in security, there are exponentially
many possible states which causes an insufficient scalability of algorithms for
real-world problems. To this end, we propose an abstraction technique that
addresses this issue of the curse of dimensionality by projecting
high-dimensional beliefs to characteristic vectors of significantly lower
dimension (e.g., marginal probabilities). Our two main contributions are (1)
novel compact representation of the uncertainty in partially observable
stochastic games and (2) novel algorithm based on this compact representation
that is based on existing state-of-the-art algorithms for solving stochastic
games with partial observability. Experimental evaluation confirms that the new
algorithm over the compact representation dramatically increases the
scalability compared to the state of the art.",Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Hypothesis-based Belief Planning for Dexterous Grasping,"Claudio Zito, Valerio Ortenzi, Maxime Adjigble, Marek Kopicki, Rustam Stolkin, Jeremy L. Wyatt","Belief space planning is a viable alternative to formalise partially
observable control problems and, in the recent years, its application to robot
manipulation problems has grown. However, this planning approach was tried
successfully only on simplified control problems. In this paper, we apply
belief space planning to the problem of planning dexterous reach-to-grasp
trajectories under object pose uncertainty. In our framework, the robot
perceives the object to be grasped on-the-fly as a point cloud and compute a
full 6D, non-Gaussian distribution over the object's pose (our belief space).
The system has no limitations on the geometry of the object, i.e., non-convex
objects can be represented, nor assumes that the point cloud is a complete
representation of the object. A plan in the belief space is then created to
reach and grasp the object, such that the information value of expected
contacts along the trajectory is maximised to compensate for the pose
uncertainty. If an unexpected contact occurs when performing the action, such
information is used to refine the pose distribution and triggers a re-planning.
Experimental results show that our planner (IR3ne) improves grasp reliability
and compensates for the pose uncertainty such that it doubles the proportion of
grasps that succeed on a first attempt.",Robotics (cs.RO),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
On the Trade-off Between Controllability and Robustness in Networks of Diffusively Coupled Agents,"Waseem Abbas, Mudassir Shabbir, A. Yasin Yazicioglu, Aqsa Akber","In this paper, we demonstrate a conflicting relationship between two crucial
properties---controllability and robustness---in linear dynamical networks of
diffusively coupled agents. In particular, for any given number of nodes $N$
and diameter $D$, we identify networks that are maximally robust using the
notion of Kirchhoff index and then analyze their strong structural
controllability. For this, we compute the minimum number of leaders, which are
the nodes directly receiving external control inputs, needed to make such
networks controllable under all feasible coupling weights between agents. Then,
for any $N$ and $D$, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the minimum number of
leaders needed to design strong structurally controllable networks with $N$
nodes and diameter $D$. We also discuss that the bound is best possible for
arbitrary $N$ and $D$. Moreover, we construct a family of graphs for any $N$
and $D$ such that the graphs have maximal edge sets (maximal robustness) while
being strong structurally controllable with the number of leaders in the
proposed sharp bound. We then analyze the robustness of this graph family. The
results suggest that optimizing robustness increases the number of leaders
needed for strong structural controllability. Our analysis is based on
graph-theoretic methods and can be applied to exploit network structure to
co-optimize robustness and controllability in networks.",Systems and Control (eess.SY),,"[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 14 Jul 2020 (this version, v2)]"
Robustness against Agent Failure in Hedonic Games,"Ayumi Igarashi, Kazunori Ota, Yuko Sakurai, Makoto Yokoo","We study how stability can be maintained even after any set of at most k
players leave their groups, in the context of hedonic games. While stability
properties ensure an outcome to be robust against players' deviations, it has
not been considered how an unexpected change caused by a sudden deletion of
players affects stable outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel criterion
that reshapes stability form robustness aspect. We observe that some stability
properties can be no longer preserved even when a single agent is removed.
However, we obtain positive results by focusing on symmetric friend-oriented
hedonic games. We prove that we can efficiently decide the existence of robust
outcomes with respect to Nash stability under deletion of any number of players
or contractual individual stability under deletion of a single player. We also
show that symmetric additively separable games always admit an individual

SciLens: Evaluating the Quality of Scientific News Articles Using Social Media and Scientific Literature Indicators,"Panayiotis Smeros, Carlos Castillo, Karl Aberer","This paper describes, develops, and validates SciLens, a method to evaluate
the quality of scientific news articles. The starting point for our work are

evaluate more accurately the quality of a scientific news article, compared to
non-experts that do not have access to these indicators. Furthermore, SciLens
can also be used to produce a completely automated quality score for an

by non-experts. One of the main elements of SciLens is the focus on both
content and context of articles, where context is provided by (1) explicit and
implicit references on the article to scientific literature, and (2) reactions
in social media referencing the article. We show that both contextual elements
can be valuable sources of information for determining article quality. The

that a number of systems are greatly affected with absolute losses in
classification accuracy of up to $29\%$ on the newly perturbed instances. Using

Learning Multi-agent Communication under Limited-bandwidth Restriction for Internet Packet Routing,"Hangyu Mao, Zhibo Gong, Zhengchao Zhang, Zhen Xiao, Yan Ni","Communication is an important factor for the big multi-agent world to stay
organized and productive. Recently, the AI community has applied the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn the communication strategy and the
control policy for multiple agents. However, when implementing the
communication for real-world multi-agent applications, there is a more
practical limited-bandwidth restriction, which has been largely ignored by the
existing DRL-based methods. Specifically, agents trained by most previous
methods keep sending messages incessantly in every control cycle; due to
emitting too many messages, these methods are unsuitable to be applied to the
real-world systems that have a limited bandwidth to transmit the messages. To
handle this problem, we propose a gating mechanism to adaptively prune
unprofitable messages. Results show that the gating mechanism can prune more

Privacy Preserving Image-Based Localization,"Pablo Speciale, Johannes L. Schönberger, Sing Bing Kang, Sudipta N. Sinha, Marc Pollefeys","Image-based localization is a core component of many augmented/mixed reality

Two-Stream Action Recognition-Oriented Video Super-Resolution,"Haochen Zhang, Dong Liu, Zhiwei Xiong","We study the video super-resolution (SR) problem for facilitating video

which motivates us to improve the SR procedure for recognition accuracy.
Tailored for two-stream action recognition networks, we propose two video SR
methods for the spatial and temporal streams respectively. On the one hand, we
observe that regions with action are more important to recognition, and we
propose an optical-flow guided weighted mean-squared-error loss for our

objects. On the other hand, we observe that existing video SR methods incur
temporal discontinuity between frames, which also worsens the recognition
accuracy, and we propose a siamese network for our temporal-oriented SR (ToSR)

Hyperspectral Data Augmentation,"Jakub Nalepa, Michal Myller, Michal Kawulok","Data augmentation is a popular technique which helps improve generalization

augmentation of hyperspectral data which is executed during the inference

GASC: Genre-Aware Semantic Change for Ancient Greek,"Valerio Perrone, Marco Palma, Simon Hengchen, Alessandro Vatri, Jim Q. Smith, Barbara McGillivray","Word meaning changes over time, depending on linguistic and extra-linguistic

Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address
this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations of
semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich
metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual
information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is

long diachronic span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between
polysemy (the fact that a word has several senses) and semantic change (the
process of acquiring, losing, or changing senses), and current systems perform
poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model

A polynomial version of Cereceda's conjecture,"Nicolas Bousquet, Marc Heinrich","Let $k$ and $d$ be such that $k \ge d+2$. Consider two $k$-colourings of a
$d$-degenerate graph $G$. Can we transform one into the other by recolouring
one vertex at each step while maintaining a proper coloring at any step?
Cereceda et al. answered that question in the affirmative, and exhibited a
recolouring sequence of exponential length. However, Cereceda conjectured that
there should exist one of quadratic length.
The $k$-reconfiguration graph of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the
proper $k$-colourings of $G$, with an edge between two colourings if they
differ on exactly one vertex. Cereceda's conjecture can be reformulated as
follows: the diameter of the $(d+2)$-reconfiguration graph of any
$d$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices is $O(n^2)$. So far, the existence of a
polynomial diameter is open even for $d=2$.
In this paper, we prove that the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph of
a $d$-degenerate graph is $O(n^{d+1})$ for $k \ge d+2$. Moreover, we prove that
if $k \ge \frac 32 (d+1)$ then the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph is
quadratic, improving the previous bound of $k \ge 2d+1$. We also show that the

box regression of an object detector to predict the position of an object in
the next frame, thereby converting a detector into a Tracktor. We demonstrate
the potential of Tracktor and provide a new state-of-the-art on three
multi-object tracking benchmarks by extending it with a straightforward
re-identification and camera motion compensation. We then perform an analysis

methods in comparison to our Tracktor. Surprisingly, none of the dedicated
tracking methods are considerably better in dealing with complex tracking
scenarios, namely, small and occluded objects or missing detections. However,
our approach tackles most of the easy tracking scenarios. Therefore, we

Mode Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Image Synthesis,"Qi Mao, Hsin-Ying Lee, Hung-Yu Tseng, Siwei Ma, Ming-Hsuan Yang","Most conditional generation tasks expect diverse outputs given a single

resolve the mode collapse issue for cGANs are usually task-specific and
computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
regularization term to address the mode collapse issue for cGANs. The proposed
method explicitly maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images
with respect to the corresponding latent codes, thus encouraging the generators
to explore more minor modes during training. This mode seeking regularization
term is readily applicable to various conditional generation tasks without
imposing training overhead or modifying the original network structures. We

transaction graphs. Despite the constant progress made on learning structured
data, there is still a lack of effective means to extract dynamic complex
features from spatio-temporal structures. Particularly, conventional models
such as convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks are incapable of
revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the
spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs
simultaneously. To tackle this problem, we design a novel multi-scale
architecture, Spatio-Temporal U-Net (ST-UNet), for graph-structured time series
modeling. In this U-shaped network, a paired sampling operation is proposed in
spacetime domain accordingly: the pooling (ST-Pool) coarsens the input graph in
spatial from its deterministic partition while abstracts multi-resolution
temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on
previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the
original structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals
within graph sequences. Experiments on spatio-temporal prediction tasks
demonstrate that our model effectively captures comprehensive features in
multiple scales and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods
on several real-world datasets.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Cleaning tasks knowledge transfer between heterogeneous robots: a deep learning approach,"Jaeseok Kim, Nino Cauli, Pedro Vicente, Bruno Damas, Alexandre Bernardino, José Santos-Victor, Filippo Cavallo","Nowadays, autonomous service robots are becoming an important topic in
robotic research. Differently from typical industrial scenarios, with highly
controlled environments, service robots must show an additional robustness to
task perturbations and changes in the characteristics of their sensory
feedback. In this paper, a robot is taught to perform two different cleaning
tasks over a table, using a learning from demonstration paradigm. However,
differently from other approaches, a convolutional neural network is used to
generalize the demonstrations to different, not yet seen dirt or stain patterns
on the same table using only visual feedback, and to perform cleaning movements
accordingly. Robustness to robot posture and illumination changes is achieved
using data augmentation techniques and camera images transformation. This
robustness allows the transfer of knowledge regarding execution of cleaning
tasks between heterogeneous robots operating in different environmental
settings. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, a network
trained in Lisbon to perform cleaning tasks, using the iCub robot, is
successfully employed by the DoRo robot in Peccioli, Italy.",Robotics (cs.RO),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),"[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 11 Sep 2019 (this version, v2)]"
A Comprehensive Analysis of 2D&3D Video Watching of EEG Signals by Increasing PLSR and SVM Classification Results,"Negin Manshouri, Temel Kayikcioglu","Despite the development of two and three dimensional (2D&3D) technology, it
has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. This research is
done to reveal the detailed effects of 2D in comparison with 3D technology on
the human brain waves. The impact of 2D&3D video watching using
electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals is studied. A group of eight healthy
volunteers with the average age of 31+-3.06 years old participated in this
three-stage test. EEG signal recording consisted of three stages: After a bit
of relaxation (a), a 2D video was displayed (b), the recording of the signal
continued for a short period of time as rest (c), and finally the trial ended.
Exactly the same steps were repeated for the 3D video. Power spectrum density
(PSD) based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to analyze the
brain signals of 2D&3D video viewers. After testing all the EEG frequency
bands, delta and theta were extracted as the features. Partial least squares
regression (PLSR) and Support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms
were considered in order to classify EEG signals obtained as the result of
2D&3D video watching. Successful classification results were obtained by
selecting the correct combinations of effective channels representing the brain

Understanding Straight-Through Estimator in Training Activation Quantized Neural Nets,"Penghang Yin, Jiancheng Lyu, Shuai Zhang, Stanley Osher, Yingyong Qi, Jack Xin","Training activation quantized neural networks involves minimizing a piecewise
constant function whose gradient vanishes almost everywhere, which is
undesirable for the standard back-propagation or chain rule. An empirical way
around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al.,
2013) in the backward pass only, so that the ""gradient"" through the modified
chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual ""gradient"" is certainly not
the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in
its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide
the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question.
We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized
ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual
""gradient"" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice
of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected
coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not
available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for
minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient
descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss
minimization problem. Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to
instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is
verified with CIFAR-10 experiments.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 25 Sep 2019 (this version, v4)]"
"Scalable Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Sparse, Locally Dense Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber Data","Laura Dominé, Kazuhiro Terao","Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show strong promise for analyzing
scientific data in many domains including particle imaging detectors such as a
liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC). Yet the high sparsity of LArTPC
data challenges traditional CNNs which were designed for dense data such as
photographs. A naive application of CNNs on LArTPC data results in inefficient
computations and a poor scalability to large LArTPC detectors such as the Short
Baseline Neutrino Program and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Recently
Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks (SSCNs) have been proposed to address
this challenge. We report their performance on a 3D semantic segmentation task
on simulated LArTPC samples. In comparison with standard CNNs, we observe that
the computation memory and wall-time cost for inference are reduced by factor
of 364 and 33 respectively without loss of accuracy. The same factors for 2D
samples are found to be 93 and 3.1 respectively. Using SSCN, we present the
first machine learning-based approach to the reconstruction of Michel electrons
using public 3D LArTPC samples. We find a Michel electron identification
efficiency of 93.9% with 96.7% of true positive rate. Reconstructed Michel
electron clusters yield 95.4% in average pixel clustering efficiency and 95.5%
in purity. The results are compelling to show strong promise of scalable data

Fuzzy Rough Set Feature Selection to Enhance Phishing Attack Detection,"Mahdieh Zabihimayvan, Derek Doran","Phishing as one of the most well-known cybercrime activities is a deception
of online users to steal their personal or confidential information by
impersonating a legitimate website. Several machine learning-based strategies
have been proposed to detect phishing websites. These techniques are dependent
on the features extracted from the website samples. However, few studies have
actually considered efficient feature selection for detecting phishing attacks.
In this work, we investigate an agreement on the definitive features which
should be used in phishing detection. We apply Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) theory as
a tool to select most effective features from three benchmarked data sets. The
selected features are fed into three often used classifiers for phishing
detection. To evaluate the FRS feature selection in developing a generalizable
phishing detection, the classifiers are trained by a separate out-of-sample
data set of 14,000 website samples. The maximum F-measure gained by FRS feature
selection is 95% using Random Forest classification. Also, there are 9
universal features selected by FRS over all the three data sets. The F-measure
value using this universal feature set is approximately 93% which is a
comparable result in contrast to the FRS performance. Since the universal
feature set contains no features from third-part services, this finding implies
that with no inquiry from external sources, we can gain a faster phishing
detection which is also robust toward zero-day attacks.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Reactive Sensing and Multiplicative Frame Super-resolution,"John J. Benedetto, Michael R. Dellomo","The problem is to evaluate the behavior of an object when primary sources of
information about the object become unavailable, so that any information must
be obtained from the intelligent use of available secondary sources. This
evaluative process is reactive sensing. Reactive sensing is initially viewed in
terms of spatial super-resolution.The theory of reactive sensing is based on
two equivalent ideas, one physical and one mathematical. The physical idea
models volume, e.g., engine volume in the case of analyzing engine health, and
the sensitivity of sensors to such volume.The mathematical idea of
multiplicative frames provides the factorization theory to compare
quantitatively such volume and sensitivity. This equivalence is the foundation

Low-Resource Syntactic Transfer with Unsupervised Source Reordering,"Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli, Michael Collins","We describe a cross-lingual transfer method for dependency parsing that takes

Neural Scene Decomposition for Multi-Person Motion Capture,"Helge Rhodin, Victor Constantin, Isinsu Katircioglu, Mathieu Salzmann, Pascal Fua","Learning general image representations has proven key to the success of many
computer vision tasks. For example, many approaches to image understanding
problems rely on deep networks that were initially trained on ImageNet, mostly
because the learned features are a valuable starting point to learn from
limited labeled data. However, when it comes to 3D motion capture of multiple
people, these features are only of limited use.
In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to learning features that are
useful for this purpose. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised approach
to learning what we call a neural scene decomposition (NSD) that can be
exploited for 3D pose estimation. NSD comprises three layers of abstraction to
represent human subjects: spatial layout in terms of bounding-boxes and
relative depth; a 2D shape representation in terms of an instance segmentation
mask; and subject-specific appearance and 3D pose information. By exploiting
self-supervision coming from multiview data, our NSD model can be trained
end-to-end without any 2D or 3D supervision. In contrast to previous
approaches, it works for multiple persons and full-frame images. Because it
encodes 3D geometry, NSD can then be effectively leveraged to train a 3D pose
estimation network from small amounts of annotated data.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 13 Mar 2019]
Putting Humans in a Scene: Learning Affordance in 3D Indoor Environments,"Xueting Li, Sifei Liu, Kihwan Kim, Xiaolong Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jan Kautz","Affordance modeling plays an important role in visual understanding. In this
paper, we aim to predict affordances of 3D indoor scenes, specifically what
human poses are afforded by a given indoor environment, such as sitting on a

possible 3D human poses in indoor scenes, we need to understand the semantic
and geometric structure of a scene as well as its potential interactions with a
human. To learn such a model, a large-scale dataset of 3D indoor affordances is
required. In this work, we build a fully automatic 3D pose synthesizer that
fuses semantic knowledge from a large number of 2D poses extracted from TV
shows as well as 3D geometric knowledge from voxel representations of indoor
scenes. With the data created by the synthesizer, we introduce a 3D pose
generative model to predict semantically plausible and physically feasible

Uncertainty Aware Learning from Demonstrations in Multiple Contexts using Bayesian Neural Networks,"Sanjay Thakur, Herke van Hoof, Juan Camilo Gamboa Higuera, Doina Precup, David Meger","Diversity of environments is a key challenge that causes learned robotic
controllers to fail due to the discrepancies between the training and
evaluation conditions. Training from demonstrations in various conditions can
mitigate---but not completely prevent---such failures. Learned controllers such
as neural networks typically do not have a notion of uncertainty that allows to
diagnose an offset between training and testing conditions, and potentially
intervene. In this work, we propose to use Bayesian Neural Networks, which have
such a notion of uncertainty. We show that uncertainty can be leveraged to
consistently detect situations in high-dimensional simulated and real robotic
domains in which the performance of the learned controller would be sub-par.
Also, we show that such an uncertainty based solution allows making an informed

ALOHA: Auxiliary Loss Optimization for Hypothesis Augmentation,"Ethan M. Rudd, Felipe N. Ducau, Cody Wild, Konstantin Berlin, Richard Harang","Malware detection is a popular application of Machine Learning for
Information Security (ML-Sec), in which an ML classifier is trained to predict
whether a given file is malware or benignware. Parameters of this classifier
are typically optimized such that outputs from the model over a set of input
samples most closely match the samples' true malicious/benign (1/0) target
labels. However, there are often a number of other sources of contextual
metadata for each malware sample, beyond an aggregate malicious/benign label,
including multiple labeling sources and malware type information (e.g.,
ransomware, trojan, etc.), which we can feed to the classifier as auxiliary
prediction targets. In this work, we fit deep neural networks to multiple
additional targets derived from metadata in a threat intelligence feed for
Portable Executable (PE) malware and benignware, including a multi-source
malicious/benign loss, a count loss on multi-source detections, and a semantic
malware attribute tag loss. We find that incorporating multiple auxiliary loss
terms yields a marked improvement in performance on the main detection task. We
also demonstrate that these gains likely stem from a more informed neural
network representation and are not due to a regularization artifact of
multi-target learning. Our auxiliary loss architecture yields a significant
reduction in detection error rate (false negatives) of 42.6% at a false

HopRank: How Semantic Structure Influences Teleportation in PageRank (A Case Study on BioPortal),"Lisette Espín-Noboa, Florian Lemmerich, Simon Walk, Markus Strohmaier, Mark A. Musen","This paper introduces HopRank, an algorithm for modeling human navigation on
semantic networks. HopRank leverages the assumption that users know or can see
the whole structure of the network. Therefore, besides following links, they
also follow nodes at certain distances (i.e., k-hop neighborhoods), and not at
random as suggested by PageRank, which assumes only links are known or visible.
We observe such preference towards k-hop neighborhoods on BioPortal, one of the
leading repositories of biomedical ontologies on the Web. In general, users
navigate within the vicinity of a concept. But they also ""jump"" to distant
concepts less frequently. We fit our model on 11 ontologies using the
transition matrix of clickstreams, and show that semantic structure can
influence teleportation in PageRank. This suggests that users--to some
extent--utilize knowledge about the underlying structure of ontologies, and
leverage it to reach certain pieces of information. Our results help the

Dulloor, Jishen Zhao, Steven Swanson","Scalable nonvolatile memory DIMMs will finally be commercially available with
the release of the Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (or just ""Optane DC
PMM""). This new nonvolatile DIMM supports byte-granularity accesses with access
times on the order of DRAM, while also providing data storage that survives
power outages. This work comprises the first in-depth, scholarly, performance
review of Intel's Optane DC PMM, exploring its capabilities as a main memory
device, and as persistent, byte-addressable memory exposed to user-space
applications. This report details the technologies performance under a number
of modes and scenarios, and across a wide variety of macro-scale benchmarks.
Optane DC PMMs can be used as large memory devices with a DRAM cache to hide
their lower bandwidth and higher latency. When used in this Memory (or cached)
mode, Optane DC memory has little impact on applications with small memory
footprints. Applications with larger memory footprints may experience some
slow-down relative to DRAM, but are now able to keep much more data in memory.
When used under a file system, Optane DC PMMs can result in significant
performance gains, especially when the file system is optimized to use the
load/store interface of the Optane DC PMM and the application uses many small,
persistent writes. For instance, using the NOVA-relaxed NVMM file system, we
can improve the performance of Kyoto Cabinet by almost 2x. Optane DC PMMs can
also enable user-space persistence where the application explicitly controls
its writes into persistent Optane DC media. In our experiments, modified
applications that used user-space Optane DC persistence generally outperformed
their file system counterparts. For instance, the persistent version of RocksDB
performed almost 2x faster than the equivalent program utilizing an NVMM-aware

Cardinality Estimation in a Virtualized Network Device Using Online Machine Learning,"Reuven Cohen, Yuval Nezri","Cardinality estimation algorithms receive a stream of elements, with possible
repetitions, and return the number of distinct elements in the stream. Such
algorithms seek to minimize the required memory and CPU resource consumption at
the price of inaccuracy in their output. In computer networks, cardinality
estimation algorithms are mainly used for counting the number of distinct
flows, and they are divided into two categories: sketching algorithms and
sampling algorithms. Sketching algorithms require the processing of all
packets, and they are therefore usually implemented by dedicated hardware.
Sampling algorithms do not require processing of all packets, but they are
known for their inaccuracy. In this work we identify one of the major drawbacks
of sampling-based cardinality estimation algorithms: their inability to adapt
to changes in flow size distribution. To address this problem, we propose a new

Maybe Deep Neural Networks are the Best Choice for Modeling Source Code,"Rafael-Michael Karampatsis, Charles Sutton","Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to

models limit the vocabulary to a fixed set of common words. For code, this
strong assumption has been shown to have a significant negative effect on
predictive performance. But the open vocabulary version of the neural network

Securing Downlink Massive MIMO-NOMA Networks with Artificial Noise,"Ming Zeng, Nam-Phong Nguyen, Octavia A. Dobre, H. Vincent Poor","In this paper, we focus on securing the confidential information of massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
networks by exploiting artificial noise (AN). An uplink training scheme is
first proposed with minimum mean squared error estimation at the base station.
Based on the estimated channel state information, the base station precodes the
confidential information and injects the AN. Following this, the ergodic
secrecy rate is derived for downlink transmission. An asymptotic secrecy
performance analysis is also carried out for a large number of transmit
antennas and high transmit power at the base station, respectively, to
highlight the effects of key parameters on the secrecy performance of the
considered system. Based on the derived ergodic secrecy rate, we propose the
joint power allocation of the uplink training phase and downlink transmission
phase to maximize the sum secrecy rates of the system. Besides, from the
perspective of security, another optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize
the energy efficiency. The results show that the combination of massive MIMO
technique and AN greatly benefits NOMA networks in term of the secrecy
performance. In addition, the effects of the uplink training phase and
clustering process on the secrecy performance are revealed. Besides, the
proposed optimization algorithms are compared with other baseline algorithms

uplink hybrid system, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is integrated
into orthogonal multiple access (OMA). To ensure the quality of service for the
users, a minimum rate requirement is pre-defined for each user. We formulate an
energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the user
clustering, channel assignment and power allocation. To address this hard
problem, a many-to-one bipartite graph is first constructed considering the
users and resource blocks (RBs) as the two sets of nodes. Based on swap
matching, a joint user-RB association and power allocation scheme is proposed,
which converges within a limited number of iterations. Moreover, for the power
allocation under a given user-RB association, we first derive the feasibility
condition. If feasible, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed, which obtains
optimal EE under any successive interference cancellation (SIC) order and an
arbitrary number of users. In addition, for the special case of two users per
cluster, analytical solutions are provided for the two SIC orders,

Energy-Efficient Power Allocation in Uplink mmWave Massive MIMO with NOMA,"Ming Zeng, Wanming Hao, Octavia A. Dobre, H.Vincent Poor","In this paper, we study the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for
an uplink millimeter wave massive multiple-input multiple-output system with
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Multiple two-user clusters are formed
according to their channel correlation and gain difference, and NOMA is applied
within each cluster. Then, a hybrid analog-digital beamforming scheme is
designed to lower the number of radio frequency chains at the base station
(BS). On this basis, we formulate a power allocation (PA) problem to maximize
the EE under users' quality of service requirements. An iterative algorithm is
proposed to obtain the PA. Moreover, an enhanced NOMA scheme is also proposed,
by exploiting the global information at the BS. Numerical results show that the
proposed NOMA schemes achieve superior EE when compared with the conventional

Consistent Dialogue Generation with Self-supervised Feature Learning,"Yizhe Zhang, Xiang Gao, Sungjin Lee, Chris Brockett, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Bill Dolan","Generating responses that are consistent with the dialogue context is one of
the central challenges in building engaging conversational agents. In this
paper, we propose a neural conversation model that generates consistent
responses by maintaining certain features related to topics and personas
throughout the conversation. Unlike past work that requires external
supervision such as user identities, which are often unavailable or classified
as sensitive information, our approach trains topic and persona feature
extractors in a self-supervised way by utilizing the natural structure of
dialogue data. Moreover, we adopt a binary feature representation and introduce
a feature disentangling loss which, paired with controllable response
generation techniques, allows us to promote or demote certain learned topics
and personas features. The evaluation result demonstrates the model's
capability of capturing meaningful topics and personas features, and the
incorporation of the learned features brings significant improvement in terms
of the quality of generated responses on two datasets, even comparing with

LPM: Learnable Pooling Module for Efficient Full-Face Gaze Estimation,"Reo Ogusu, Takao Yamanaka","Gaze tracking is an important technology in many domains. Techniques such as
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has allowed the invention of gaze tracking

provide better performance than from an eye image alone. However, a problem
with using the full-face image is the heavy computation due to the larger image
size. This study tackles this problem through compression of the input
full-face image by removing redundant information using a novel learnable
pooling module. The module can be trained end-to-end by backpropagation to
learn the size of the grid in the pooling filter. The learnable pooling module

Simulating Emergent Properties of Human Driving Behavior Using Multi-Agent Reward Augmented Imitation Learning,"Raunak P. Bhattacharyya, Derek J. Phillips, Changliu Liu, Jayesh K.

results for modeling the behavior of human drivers. However, it is challenging
to capture emergent traffic behaviors that are observed in real-world datasets.
Such behaviors arise due to the many local interactions between agents that are

Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which integrates reward augmentation into
the multi-agent imitation learning framework and allows the designer to specify
prior knowledge in a principled fashion. We prove that convergence guarantees
for the imitation learning process are preserved under the application of
reward augmentation. This method is validated in a driving scenario, where an

Geometric Tiles and Powers and Limitations of Geometric Hindrance in Self-Assembly,"Daniel Hader, Matthew J. Patitz","Tile-based self-assembly systems are capable of universal computation and
algorithmically-directed growth. Systems capable of such behavior typically
make use of ""glue cooperation"" in which the glues on at least $2$ sides of a
tile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for
that tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize
""weak cooperation"", where only a single glue needs to bind but other
preventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide
additional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for
algorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are
allowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such
tiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using
asymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents), and also how they can
simulate weakly cooperative systems in a model which allows for duples (i.e.
tiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles). We then show that
with only weak cooperation via geometric hindrance, no system in any model can
simulate even a class of tightly constrained, deterministic cooperative
systems, further defining the boundary of what is possible using this tool.",Emerging Technologies (cs.ET),; Computational Geometry (cs.CG),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]

the supremum of marginal KL divergences over all finite sets of inputs. Based
on this, we introduce a practical training objective which approximates the
functional ELBO using finite measurement sets and the spectral Stein gradient
estimator. With fBNNs, we can specify priors entailing rich structures,

Diagnosing and Enhancing VAE Models,"Bin Dai, David Wipf","Although variational autoencoders (VAEs) represent a widely influential deep

Queue-Aware Variable-Length Coding for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications with Random Arrival,"Xiaoyu Zhao, Wei Chen","With the phenomenal growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), Ultra Reliable

to achieve low latency and ultra-reliability with the random arrival remains

over the single URLLC user link, in which the finite blocklength of channel
coding is determined based on the random arrival. More particularly, a
cross-layer approach is proposed for the URLLC user to establish the optimal
tradeoff between the latency and power consumption. With a probabilistic coding

Neural Style Transfer for Point Clouds,"Xu Cao, Weimin Wang, Katashi Nagao","How can we edit or transform the geometric or color property of a point

achieved by manipulating the content representations and Gram-based style
representations extracted from a pre-trained PointNet-based classification
network for colored point clouds. As Gram-based style representation is
invariant to the number or the order of points, the same method can be extended
to transfer the style extracted from an image to the color expression of a

Persistification of Robotic Tasks,"Gennaro Notomista, Magnus Egerstedt","In this paper we propose a control framework that enables robots to execute
tasks persistently, i.e., over time horizons much longer than robots' battery

the robots is never depleted. This is framed as a set invariance constraint in
an optimization problem whose objective is that of minimizing the difference
between the robots' control inputs and nominal control inputs corresponding to
the task that is to be executed. We refer to this process as the
persistification of a robotic task. Forward invariance of subsets of the state
space of the robots is turned into a control input constraint by using control
barrier functions. The solution of the formulated optimization problem with
energy constraints ensures that the robotic task is persistent. To illustrate
the operation of the proposed framework, we consider two tasks whose persistent
execution is particularly relevant: environment exploration and environment
surveillance. We show the persistification of these two tasks both in

A New Approach for Distributed Hypothesis Testing with Extensions to Byzantine-Resilience,"Aritra Mitra, John A. Richards, Shreyas Sundaram","We study a setting where a group of agents, each receiving partially
informative private observations, seek to collaboratively learn the true state
(among a set of hypotheses) that explains their joint observation profiles over
time. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed learning rule that
differs fundamentally from existing approaches, in the sense, that it does not
employ any form of ""belief-averaging"". Specifically, every agent maintains a
local belief (on each hypothesis) that is updated in a Bayesian manner without
any network influence, and an actual belief that is updated (up to
normalization) as the minimum of its own local belief and the actual beliefs of
its neighbors. Under minimal requirements on the signal structures of the
agents and the underlying communication graph, we establish consistency of the
proposed belief update rule, i.e., we show that the actual beliefs of the
agents asymptotically concentrate on the true state almost surely. As one of
the key benefits of our approach, we show that our learning rule can be
extended to scenarios that capture misbehavior on the part of certain agents in
the network, modeled via the Byzantine adversary model. In particular, we prove
that each non-adversarial agent can asymptotically learn the true state of the
world almost surely, under appropriate conditions on the observation model and
the network topology.",Systems and Control (eess.SY),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]

Distributed Detection with Empirically Observed Statistics,"Haiyun He, Lin Zhou, Vincent Y. F. Tan","Consider a distributed detection problem in which the underlying
distributions of the observations are unknown; instead of these distributions,
noisy versions of empirically observed statistics are available to the fusion
center. These empirically observed statistics, together with source (test)
sequences, are transmitted through different channels to the fusion center. The
fusion center decides which distribution the source sequence is sampled from
based on these data. For the binary case, we derive the optimal type-II error
exponent given that the type-I error decays exponentially fast. The type-II
error exponent is maximized over the proportions of channels for both source
and training sequences. We conclude that as the ratio of the lengths of
training to test sequences $\alpha$ tends to infinity, using only one channel
is optimal. By calculating the derived exponents numerically, we conjecture
that the same is true when $\alpha$ is finite. We relate our results to the
classical distributed detection problem studied by Tsitsiklis, in which the
underlying distributions are known. Finally, our results are extended to the

Purifying Naturalistic Images through a Real-time Style Transfer Semantics Network,"Tongtong Zhao, Yuxiao Yan, Ibrahim Shehi Shehu, Xianping Fu, Huibing Wang","Recently, the progress of learning-by-synthesis has proposed a training model
for synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of human and
material resources. However, due to the different distribution of synthetic
images compared to real images, the desired performance cannot still be
achieved. Real images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while
synthetic images consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are
considered to be characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To
solve this problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism
of the synthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper takes
the first step to purify real images. Through the style transfer task, the
distribution of outdoor real images is converted into indoor synthetic images,
thereby reducing the influence of light. Therefore, this paper proposes a
real-time style transfer network that preserves image content information (eg,
gaze direction, pupil center position) of an input image (real image) while
inferring style information (eg, image color structure, semantic features) of
style image (synthetic image). In addition, the network accelerates the
convergence speed of the model and adapts to multi-scale images. Experiments
were performed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to
demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions.
Qualitatively, it compares the proposed method with the available methods in a
series of indoor and outdoor scenarios of the LPW dataset. In quantitative
terms, it evaluates the purified image by training a gaze estimation model on

Attribution-driven Causal Analysis for Detection of Adversarial Examples,"Susmit Jha, Sunny Raj, Steven Lawrence Fernandes, Sumit Kumar Jha, Somesh Jha, Gunjan Verma, Brian Jalaian, Ananthram Swami","Attribution methods have been developed to explain the decision of a machine
learning model on a given input. We use the Integrated Gradient method for

incrementally masking high attribution features. We study the robustness of

Our study indicates that benign inputs are robust to the masking of high
attribution features but adversarial inputs generated by the state-of-the-art
adversarial attack methods such as DeepFool, FGSM, CW and PGD, are not robust
to such masking. Further, our study demonstrates that this concentration of
high-attribution features responsible for the incorrect decision is more
pronounced in physically realizable adversarial examples. This difference in

Covert Networks: How Hard is It to Hide?,"Palash Dey, Sourav Medya","Covert networks are social networks that often consist of harmful users.
Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal
activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in
such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential

miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners

new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem,
called Hiding Leader, is NP-Complete for the degree and closeness centrality
measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the
problem is NP-Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only
$3$. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time
solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is
bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the
problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a $2$ factor
approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by
proving that one cannot hope to have any $(2-\varepsilon)$ factor approximation

present the \underline{f}low \underline{av}ailability \underline{e}stimation

so flow availabilities cannot be evaluated analytically and simulation is often

take an excessive amount of time. To quickly estimate flow availabilities, we
utilize the correlations among link and flow failures to figure out the
importance of roles played by different links in flow failures, and design
three ""sequential importance sampling"" (SIS) methods which achieve ""bounded or
even vanishing relative error"" with linear computational complexities. When
applying to a realistic network, our method reduces the flow availability

Hadoop Perfect File: A fast access container for small files with direct in disc metadata access,"Jude Tchaye-Kondi, Yanlong Zhai, Kwei-Jay Lin, Wenjun Tao, Kai Yang","Storing and processing massive small files is one of the major challenges for
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). In order to provide fast data
access, the NameNode (NN) in HDFS maintains the metadata of all files in its
main-memory. Hadoop performs well with a small number of large files that
require relatively little metadata in the NN s memory. But for a large number
of small files, Hadoop has problems such as NN memory overload caused by the
huge metadata size of these small files. We present a new type of archive file,
Hadoop Perfect File (HPF), to solve HDFS s small files problem by merging small
files into a large file on HDFS. Existing archive files offer limited
functionality and have poor performance when accessing a file in the merged
file due to the fact that during metadata lookup it is necessary to read and
process the entire index file(s). In contrast, HPF file can directly access the
metadata of a particular file from its index file without having to process it
entirely. The HPF index system uses two hash functions: file s metadata are
distributed through index files by using a dynamic hash function and, for each
index file, we build an order preserving perfect hash function that preserves
the position of each file s metadata in the index file. The HPF design will
only read the part of the index file that contains the metadata of the searched
file during its access. HPF file also supports the file appending functionality
after its creation. Our experiments show that HPF can be more than 40% faster
file s access from the original HDFS. If we don t consider the caching effect,
HPF s file access is around 179% faster than MapFile and 11294% faster than HAR
file. If we consider caching effect, HPF is around 35% faster than MapFile and

device before the relay of network traffic through it, and disappears from the
network immediately after inflicting the device. The attack leverages the
captive portal facility of wireless networks to launch D2D attack. We configure
an ET to launch a malicious component of an already installed app in the device
on submission of the portal page. In this paper, we present an online,
incremental, automated, fingerprinting based pre-association detection
mechanism named as ETGuard which works as a client-server mechanism in
real-time. The fingerprints are constructed from the beacon frames transmitted
by the wireless APs periodically to inform client devices of their presence and
capabilities in a network. Once detected, ETGuard continuously transmits
deauthentication frames to prevent clients from connecting to an ET. ETGuard
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques from various perspectives.
Our technique does not require any expensive hardware, does not modify any
protocols, does not rely on any network specific parameters such as Round Trip
Time (RTT), number of hops, etc., can be deployed in a real network, is
incremental, and operates passively to detect ETs in real-time. To evaluate the
efficiency, we deploy ETGuard in 802.11a/b/g wireless networks. The experiments
are conducted using 12 different attack scenarios where each scenario differs
in the source used for introducing an ET. ETGuard effectively detects ETs
introduced either through a hardware, software, or mobile hotspot with high
accuracy, only one false positive scenario, and no false negatives.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),; Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]

MirrorGAN: Learning Text-to-image Generation by Redescription,"Tingting Qiao, Jing Zhang, Duanqing Xu, Dacheng Tao","Generating an image from a given text description has two goals: visual
realism and semantic consistency. Although significant progress has been made
in generating high-quality and visually realistic images using generative
adversarial networks, guaranteeing semantic consistency between the text
description and visual content remains very challenging. In this paper, we
address this problem by proposing a novel global-local attentive and
semantic-preserving text-to-image-to-text framework called MirrorGAN. MirrorGAN
exploits the idea of learning text-to-image generation by redescription and
consists of three modules: a semantic text embedding module (STEM), a
global-local collaborative attentive module for cascaded image generation
(GLAM), and a semantic text regeneration and alignment module (STREAM). STEM
generates word- and sentence-level embeddings. GLAM has a cascaded architecture
for generating target images from coarse to fine scales, leveraging both local
word attention and global sentence attention to progressively enhance the
diversity and semantic consistency of the generated images. STREAM seeks to
regenerate the text description from the generated image, which semantically
aligns with the given text description. Thorough experiments on two public
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MirrorGAN over other
representative state-of-the-art methods.",Computation and Language (cs.CL),; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]
Varying-order NURBS discretization: An accurate and efficient method for isogeometric analysis of large deformation contact problems,"Vishal Agrawal, Sachin S. Gautam","In this paper, a novel varying order NURBS discretization method is proposed
to enhance the performance of isogeometric analysis within the framework of
computational contact mechanics. The method makes use of higher-order NURBS for
contact integral evaluations. Lower-orders NURBS capable of modelling complex
geometries exactly are utilized for the bulk discretization. This unexplored
idea provides the possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order
elevation strategy for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order
NURBS layer is used as the contact boundary layer of the bodies. The NURBS
layer is constructed using the surface refinement strategies such that it is
accompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with
the bulk parametrization.
The validity of the presented isogeometric mortar contact formulation with
varying-order NURBS discretization is first examined through the contact patch
test. The capabilities and benefits of the proposed methodology are then
demonstrated in detail using two-dimensional frictionless and frictional
contact problems, considering both small and large deformations. It is shown
that using the proposed method, accurate solutions can be achieved even with a
coarse mesh. It is also shown that the current method requires a considerably
lower computational cost compared to standard NURBS discretization while
retaining robustness and stability. The simplicity of the method lends itself
to be conveniently embedded in an existing isogeometric contact code after only
a few minor modifications.",Numerical Analysis (math.NA),,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 2 Jun 2020 (this version, v3)]"
Learning Orientation-Estimation Convolutional Neural Network for Building Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Image,Yongliang Chen,"Benefiting from the great success of deep learning in computer vision,
CNN-based object detection methods have drawn significant attentions. Various
frameworks have been proposed which show awesome and robust performance for a
large range of datasets. However, for building detection in remote sensing
images, buildings always pose a diversity of orientations which makes it a
challenge for the application of off-the-shelf methods to building detection.
In this work, we aim to integrate orientation regression into the popular
axis-aligned bounding-box detection method to tackle this problem. To adapt the
axis-aligned bounding boxes to arbitrarily orientated ones, we also develop an
algorithm to estimate the Intersection over Union (IoU) overlap between any two
arbitrarily oriented boxes which is convenient to implement in Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU) for accelerating computation. The proposed method
utilizes CNN for both robust feature extraction and rotated bounding box
regression. We present our modelin an end-to-end fashion making it easy to
train. The model is formulated and trained to predict orientation, location and
extent simultaneously obtaining tighter bounding box and hence, higher mean
average precision (mAP). Experiments on remote sensing images of different

Non-Coherent Joint Transmission in Poisson Cellular Networks Under Pilot Contamination,"Stelios Stefanatos, Gerhard Wunder","This paper investigates the performance of downlink cellular networks with
non-coherent joint (mutlipoint) transmissions and practical channel estimation.
Under a stochastic geometry framework, the spatial average
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is characterized, taking into account the effect of
channel estimation error due to pilot contamination. A simple, easy to compute
SNR expression is obtained under the assumption of randomly generated pilot
sequences and minimal prior information about the channels and positions of
access points (APs). This SNR expression allows for the efficient joint
optimization of critical system design parameters such as number of cooperating
APs and training overhead. Among others, it is shown that multipoint
transmissions are preferable to conventional (non-cooperative) cellular
operation under certain operational conditions. Furthermore, analytical
insights are obtained regarding (a) the minimum training overhead required to
achieve a given SNR degradation compared to the perfect channel estimation case
and (b) the optimal number of cooperating APs when an arbitrarily large
training overhead can be afforded. For the latter, in particular, a phase
transition phenomenon is identified, where the optimal number of cooperating
APs is either finite or infinite, depending on whether the path loss factor is
less or equal than a certain value, respectively.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 1 Jul 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Interactive Concept Mining on Personal Data -- Bootstrapping Semantic Services,"Markus Schröder, Christian Jilek, Andreas Dengel","Semantic services (e.g. Semantic Desktops) are still afflicted by a cold
start problem: in the beginning, the user's personal information sphere, i.e.

A Functional (Monadic) Second-Order Theory of Infinite Trees,"Anupam Das, Colin Riba","This paper presents a complete axiomatization of Monadic Second-Order Logic

complete deduction system with a polynomial-time recognizable set of axioms. By
naive enumeration of formal derivations, this formally gives a proof of Rabin's
Tree Theorem. The deduction system consists of the usual rules for second-order
logic seen as two-sorted first-order logic, together with the natural

determinacy of certain parity games. The main difficulty resides in the limited
expressive power of the language of MSO. We actually devise an extension of

Simply RaTT: A Fitch-style Modal Calculus for Reactive Programming without Space Leaks,"Patrick Bahr, Christian Graulund, Rasmus Møgelberg","Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a paradigm for programming with
signals and events, allowing the user to describe reactive programs on a high
level of abstraction. For this to make sense, an FRP language must ensure that
all programs are causal, and can be implemented without introducing space leaks
and time leaks. To this end, some FRP languages do not give direct access to
signals, but just to signal functions.
Recently, modal types have been suggested as an alternative approach to
ensuring causality in FRP languages in the synchronous case, giving direct
access to the signal and event abstractions. This paper presents Simply RaTT, a
new modal calculus for reactive programming. Unlike prior calculi, Simply RaTT
uses a Fitch-style approach to modal types, which simplifies the type system
and makes programs more concise. Echoing a previous result by Krishnaswami for
a different language, we devise an operational semantics that safely executes
Simply RaTT programs without space leaks.
We also identify a source of time leaks present in other modal FRP languages:
The unfolding of fixed points in delayed computations. These time leaks are

trajectories lie in S at t $\in$ [0,T]. We then give sufficient conditions
which ensure that the exact trajectories, under the same control, also lie in S

Learning to Reconstruct People in Clothing from a Single RGB Camera,"Thiemo Alldieck, Marcus Magnor, Bharat Lal Bhatnagar, Christian Theobalt, Gerard Pons-Moll","We present a learning-based model to infer the personalized 3D shape of
people from a few frames (1-8) of a monocular video in which the person is
moving, in less than 10 seconds with a reconstruction accuracy of 5mm. Our
model learns to predict the parameters of a statistical body model and instance
displacements that add clothing and hair to the shape. The model achieves fast
and accurate predictions based on two key design choices. First, by predicting
shape in a canonical T-pose space, the network learns to encode the images of
the person into pose-invariant latent codes, where the information is fused.
Second, based on the observation that feed-forward predictions are fast but do
not always align with the input images, we predict using both, bottom-up and
top-down streams (one per view) allowing information to flow in both
directions. Learning relies only on synthetic 3D data. Once learned, the model

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations,"Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré","Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the
discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured
transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be
represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized
and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent
hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what
structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to
automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform.
Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as
products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of
divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of
transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient
algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the $O(N \log

$1024$. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight
replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn
efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a

A Random Walk based Trust Ranking in Distributed Systems,"Alexander Stannat, Johan Pouwelse","Honest cooperation among individuals in a network can be achieved in
different ways. In online networks with some kind of central authority, such as
Ebay, Airbnb, etc. honesty is achieved through a reputation system, which is

review mechanisms, through which agents can evaluate the trustworthiness of
their interaction partners. These reviews are stored centrally and are
tamper-proof. In decentralized peer-to-peer networks, enforcing cooperation
turns out to be more difficult. One way of approaching this problem is by
observing cooperative biological communities in nature. One finds that
cooperation among biological organisms is achieved through a mechanism called
indirect reciprocity. This mechanism for cooperation relies on some shared
notion of trust. In this work we aim to facilitate communal cooperation in a
peer-to-peer file sharing network called Tribler, by introducing a mechanism
for evaluating the trustworthiness of agents. We determine a trust ranking of
all nodes in the network based on the Monte Carlo algorithm estimating the

Incremental Learning of Discrete Planning Domains from Continuous Perceptions,"Luciano Serafini, Paolo Traverso","We propose a framework for learning discrete deterministic planning domains.
In this framework, an agent learns the domain by observing the action effects
through continuous features that describe the state of the environment after
the execution of each action. Besides, the agent learns its perception
function, i.e., a probabilistic mapping between state variables and sensor data
represented as a vector of continuous random variables called perception
variables. We define an algorithm that updates the planning domain and the
perception function by (i) introducing new states, either by extending the
possible values of state variables, or by weakening their constraints; (ii)
adapts the perception function to fit the observed data (iii) adapts the
transition function on the basis of the executed actions and the effects
observed via the perception function. The framework is able to deal with
exogenous events that happen in the environment.",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 19 Apr 2019 (this version, v2)]"

Dense Relational Captioning: Triple-Stream Networks for Relationship-Based Captioning,"Dong-Jin Kim, Jinsoo Choi, Tae-Hyun Oh, In So Kweon","Our goal in this work is to train an image captioning model that generates

captioning is a framework that is advantageous in both diversity and amount of
information, leading to image understanding based on relationships. Part-of
speech (POS, i.e. subject-object-predicate categories) tags can be assigned to
every English word. We leverage the POS as a prior to guide the correct
sequence of words in a caption. To this end, we propose a multi-task

Fast Approximate Shortest Paths in the Congested Clique,"Keren Censor-Hillel, Michal Dory, Janne H. Korhonen, Dean Leitersdorf","We design fast deterministic algorithms for distance computation in the
congested clique model. Our key contributions include:

$O(\log^2{n} / \epsilon)$ rounds on unweighted undirected graphs. With a small
additional additive factor, this also applies for weighted graphs. This is the
first sub-polynomial constant-factor approximation for APSP in this model.

Low-rank Kernel Learning for Graph-based Clustering,"Zhao Kang, Liangjian Wen, Wenyu Chen, Zenglin Xu","Constructing the adjacency graph is fundamental to graph-based clustering.
Graph learning in kernel space has shown impressive performance on a number of
benchmark data sets. However, its performance is largely determined by the
chosen kernel matrix. To address this issue, the previous multiple kernel
learning algorithm has been applied to learn an optimal kernel from a group of
predefined kernels. This approach might be sensitive to noise and limits the
representation ability of the consensus kernel. In contrast to existing
methods, we propose to learn a low-rank kernel matrix which exploits the
similarity nature of the kernel matrix and seeks an optimal kernel from the
neighborhood of candidate kernels. By formulating graph construction and kernel
learning in a unified framework, the graph and consensus kernel can be
iteratively enhanced by each other. Extensive experimental results validate the

"Rectified Decision Trees: Towards Interpretability, Compression and Empirical Soundness","Jiawang Bai, Yiming Li, Jiawei Li, Yong Jiang, Shutao Xia","How to obtain a model with good interpretability and performance has always
been an important research topic. In this paper, we propose rectified decision
trees (ReDT), a knowledge distillation based decision trees rectification with

we extend the impurity calculation and the pure ending condition of the
classical decision tree to propose a decision tree extension that allows the
use of soft labels generated by a well-trained teacher model in training and
prediction process. It is worth noting that for the acquisition of soft labels,
we propose a new multiple cross-validation based method to reduce the effects
of randomness and overfitting. These approaches ensure that ReDT retains
excellent interpretability and even achieves fewer nodes than the decision tree
in the aspect of compression while having relatively good performance. Besides,
in contrast to traditional knowledge distillation, back propagation of the
student model is not necessarily required in ReDT, which is an attempt of a new
knowledge distillation approach. Extensive experiments are conducted, which

"Unsupervised Network Embedding for Graph Visualization, Clustering and Classification","Leonardo Gutiérrez-Gómez, Jean-Charles Delvenne","A main challenge in mining network-based data is finding effective ways to
represent or encode graph structures so that it can be efficiently exploited by

representation at node/edge or substructure level. However, many real life
challenges such as time-varying, multilayer, chemical compounds and brain
networks involve analysis of a family of graphs instead of single one opening
additional challenges in graph comparison and representation. Traditional
approaches for learning representations relies on hand-crafting specialized
heuristics to extract meaningful information about the graphs, e.g statistical
properties, structural features, etc. as well as engineered graph distances to
quantify dissimilarity between networks. In this work we provide an
unsupervised approach to learn embedding representation for a collection of

unsupervised neural network approach on input graphs, we aim to capture the
underlying distribution of the data in order to discriminate between different

Expressing Trust with Temporal Frequency of User Interaction in Online Communities,"Ekaterina Yashkina, Arseny Pinigin, JooYoung Lee, Manuel Mazzara, Akinlolu Solomon Adekotujo, Adam Zubair, Luca Longo","Reputation systems concern soft security dynamics in diverse areas. Trust

Fault Tolerant Network Constructors,"Othon Michail, Paul G. Spirakis, Michail Theofilatos","In this work, we consider adversarial crash faults of nodes in the network
constructors model $[$Michail and Spirakis, 2016$]$. We first show that,
without further assumptions, the class of graph languages that can be (stably)
constructed under crash faults is non-empty but small. In particular, if an
unbounded number of crash faults may occur, we prove that (i) the only
constructible graph language is that of spanning cliques and (ii) a strong
impossibility result holds even if the size of the graphs that the protocol
outputs in populations of size $n$ need only grow with $n$ (the remaining nodes
being waste). When there is a finite upper bound $f$ on the number of faults,
we show that it is impossible to construct any non-hereditary graph language.
On the positive side, by relaxing our requirements we prove that: (i)
permitting linear waste enables to construct on $n/(2f)-f$ nodes, any graph
language that is constructible in the fault-free case, (ii) partial
constructibility (i.e. not having to generate all graphs in the language)
allows the construction of a large class of graph languages. We then extend the
original model with a minimal form of fault notifications. Our main result here
is a fault-tolerant universal constructor: We develop a fault-tolerant protocol
for spanning line and use it to simulate a linear-space Turing Machine $M$.
This allows a fault-tolerant construction of any graph accepted by $M$ in
linear space, with waste $min\{n/2+f(n),\; n\}$, where $f(n)$ is the number of
faults in the execution. We then prove that increasing the permissible waste to
$min\{2n/3+f(n),\; n\}$ allows the construction of graphs accepted by an
$O(n^2)$-space Turing Machine, which is asymptotically the maximum simulation
space that we can hope for in this model. Finally, we show that logarithmic
local memories can be exploited for a no-waste fault-tolerant simulation of any
such protocol.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 18 May 2019 (this version, v2)]"

Can Adversarial Network Attack be Defended?,"Jinyin Chen, Yangyang Wu, Xiang Lin, Qi Xuan","Machine learning has been successfully applied to complex network analysis in
various areas, and graph neural networks (GNNs) based methods outperform

attention since carefully crafted adversarial networks with slight

strategies to improve GNNs' defensibility against attacks. Then, we
analytically investigate the robustness properties for GNNs granted by the use
of smooth defense, and propose two special smooth defense strategies: smoothing
distillation and smoothing cross-entropy loss function. Both of them are
capable of smoothing gradient of GNNs, and consequently reduce the amplitude of
adversarial gradients, which benefits gradient masking from attackers. The

Estimating Social Influence Using Latent Space Adjusted Approach in R,Ran Xu,"Social influence, sometimes referred to as spillover or contagion, have been

analysis is only possible by representing the distribution system in detail

shows that it operates on signed graphs, where nodes belonging to one same
class are more likely to share positive edges while nodes from different
classes are more likely to be connected with negative edges. It is shown that
by selecting an optimal $\gamma$, classification performance can be

Dynamics Concentration of Large-Scale Tightly-Connected Networks,"Hancheng Min, Enrique Mallada","The ability to achieve coordinated behavior --engineered or emergent-- on
networked systems has attracted widespread interest over several fields. This
has led to remarkable advances on the development of a theoretical
understanding of the conditions under which agents within a network can reach
agreement (consensus) or develop coordinated behaviors such as synchronization.
However, fewer advances have been made toward explaining another commonly
observed phenomena in tightly-connected networks systems: output responses of
nodes in the networks are almost identical to each other despite heterogeneity
in their individual dynamics. In this paper, we leverage tools from
high-dimensional probability to provide an initial answer to this phenomena.
More precisely, we show that for linear networks of nodal random transfer
functions, as the network size and connectivity grows, every node in the
network follows the same response to an input or disturbance --irrespectively
of the source of this input. We term this behavior as dynamics concentration
since it stems from the fact that the network transfer matrix uniformly
converges in probability, i.e., it concentrates, to a unique dynamic response
determined by the distribution of the random transfer function of each node. We
further discuss the implications of our analysis in the context of model
reduction and robustness, and provide numerical evidence that similar phenomena

depends affinely on both subsystem parameters and subsystem connections. These
conditions keep the property that all the involved numerical computations are
performed on each subsystem independently, which is attractive in the analysis

Multi-target detection with application to cryo-electron microscopy,"Tamir Bendory, Nicolas Boumal, William Leeb, Eitan Levin, Amit Singer","We consider the multi-target detection problem of recovering a set of signals
that appear multiple times at unknown locations in a noisy measurement. In the
low noise regime, one can estimate the signals by first detecting occurrences,
then clustering and averaging them. In the high noise regime however, neither
detection nor clustering can be performed reliably, so that strategies along
these lines are destined to fail. Notwithstanding, using autocorrelation
analysis, we show that the impossibility to detect and cluster signal
occurrences in the presence of high noise does not necessarily preclude signal
estimation. Specifically, to estimate the signals, we derive simple relations
between the autocorrelations of the observation and those of the signals. These
autocorrelations can be estimated accurately at any noise level given a
sufficiently long measurement. To recover the signals from the observed
autocorrelations, we solve a set of polynomial equations through nonlinear
least-squares. We provide analysis regarding well-posedness of the task, and

fusion in this context. This paper presents a framework that extends the
well-established theory of nonlinear dynamical systems with the notion of
dynamic stream weights for an arbitrary number of sensory observations. It
comprises a recursive state estimator based on the Gaussian filtering paradigm,
which incorporates dynamic stream weights into a framework closely related to
the extended Kalman filter. Additionally, a convex optimization approach to
estimate oracle dynamic stream weights in fully observed dynamical systems
utilizing a Dirichlet prior is presented. This serves as a basis for a generic
parameter learning framework of dynamic stream weight estimators. The proposed
system is application-independent and can be easily adapted to specific tasks
and requirements. A study using audiovisual speaker tracking tasks is
considered as an exemplary application in this work. An improved tracking
performance of the dynamic stream weight-based estimation framework over
state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated in the experiments.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]
What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study With Research Software Engineers,"Mario Rosado de Souza, Robert Haines, Markel Vigo, Caroline Jay","Software is now a vital scientific instrument, providing the tools for data
collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and
computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is
often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and
rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent
`reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sustainable research
software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest
to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open
question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how
research software engineers -- the people actively developing software in an
academic research environment -- subjectively define software sustainability.
Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions:
\emph{intrinsic sustainability}, which relates to internal qualities of
software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and
\emph{extrinsic sustainability}, concerning cultural and organisational
factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research
software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability
are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.",Software Engineering (cs.SE),; Computers and Society (cs.CY),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]
Normal 6-edge-colorings of some bridgeless cubic graphs,"Giuseppe Mazzuoccolo, Vahan Mkrtchyan","In an edge-coloring of a cubic graph, an edge is poor or rich, if the set of
colors assigned to the edge and the four edges adjacent it, has exactly five or
exactly three distinct colors, respectively. An edge is normal in an
edge-coloring if it is rich or poor in this coloring. A normal
$k$-edge-coloring of a cubic graph is an edge-coloring with $k$ colors such
that each edge of the graph is normal. We denote by $\chi'_{N}(G)$ the smallest
$k$, for which $G$ admits a normal $k$-edge-coloring. Normal edge-colorings
were introduced by Jaeger in order to study his well-known Petersen Coloring
Conjecture. It is known that proving $\chi'_{N}(G)\leq 5$ for every bridgeless
cubic graph is equivalent to proving Petersen Coloring Conjecture. Moreover,
Jaeger was able to show that it implies classical conjectures like Cycle Double
Cover Conjecture and Berge-Fulkerson Conjecture. Recently, two of the authors
were able to show that any simple cubic graph admits a normal
$7$-edge-coloring, and this result is best possible. In the present paper, we
show that any claw-free bridgeless cubic graph, permutation snark, tree-like
snark admits a normal $6$-edge-coloring. Finally, we show that any bridgeless
cubic graph $G$ admits a $6$-edge-coloring such that at least $\frac{7}{9}\cdot

Using Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics to Prioritize Outpatients in HetNets,"Mohammed Hadi, Ahmed Lawey, Taisir El-Gorashi, Jaafar Elmirghani","In this paper, we introduce machine learning approaches that are used to
prioritize outpatients (OP) according to their current health state, resulting
in self-optimizing heterogeneous networks (HetNet) that intelligently adapt
according to users' needs. We use a naïve Bayesian classifier to analyze data
acquired from OPs' medical records, alongside data from medical Internet of
Things (IoT) sensors that provide the current state of the OP. We use this
machine learning algorithm to calculate the likelihood of a life-threatening
medical condition, in this case an imminent stroke. An OP is assigned
high-powered resource blocks (RBs) according to the seriousness of their
current health state, enabling them to remain connected and send their critical
data to the designated medical facility with minimal delay. Using a mixed
integer linear programming formulation (MILP), we present two approaches to
optimizing the uplink side of a HetNet in terms of user-RB assignment: a
Weighted Sum Rate Maximization (WSRMax) approach and a Proportional Fairness
(PF) approach. Using these approaches, we illustrate the utility of the
proposed system in terms of providing reliable connectivity to medical IoT
sensors, enabling the OPs to maintain the quality and speed of their

MSG-GAN: Multi-Scale Gradients for Generative Adversarial Networks,"Animesh Karnewar, Oliver Wang","While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have seen huge successes in
image synthesis tasks, they are notoriously difficult to adapt to different
datasets, in part due to instability during training and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. One commonly accepted reason for this instability is that
gradients passing from the discriminator to the generator become uninformative
when there isn't enough overlap in the supports of the real and fake
distributions. In this work, we propose the Multi-Scale Gradient Generative
Adversarial Network (MSG-GAN), a simple but effective technique for addressing
this by allowing the flow of gradients from the discriminator to the generator
at multiple scales. This technique provides a stable approach for high
resolution image synthesis, and serves as an alternative to the commonly used
progressive growing technique. We show that MSG-GAN converges stably on a
variety of image datasets of different sizes, resolutions and domains, as well
as different types of loss functions and architectures, all with the same set
of fixed hyperparameters. When compared to state-of-the-art GANs, our approach

Robust Matrix Completion via Maximum Correntropy Criterion and Half Quadratic Optimization,"Yicong He, Fei Wang, Yingsong Li, Jing Qin, Badong Chen","Robust matrix completion aims to recover a low-rank matrix from a subset of
noisy entries perturbed by complex noises, where traditional methods for matrix
completion may perform poorly due to utilizing $l_2$ error norm in
optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel and fast robust matrix
completion method based on maximum correntropy criterion (MCC). The correntropy
based error measure is utilized instead of using $l_2$-based error norm to
improve the robustness to noises. Using the half-quadratic optimization
technique, the correntropy based optimization can be transformed to a weighted
matrix factorization problem. Then, two efficient algorithms are derived,
including alternating minimization based algorithm and alternating gradient
descend based algorithm. The proposed algorithms do not need to calculate
singular value decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. Further, the adaptive
kernel selection strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence speed as
well as improve the performance. Comparison with existing robust matrix
completion algorithms is provided by simulations, showing that the new methods

Stochastic Beams and Where to Find Them: The Gumbel-Top-k Trick for Sampling Sequences Without Replacement,"Wouter Kool, Herke van Hoof, Max Welling","The well-known Gumbel-Max trick for sampling from a categorical distribution

Stochastic Beam Search. Even for exponentially large domains, the number of
model evaluations grows only linear in $k$ and the maximum sampled sequence
length. The algorithm creates a theoretical connection between sampling and
(deterministic) beam search and can be used as a principled intermediate
alternative. In a translation task, the proposed method compares favourably

Maximum Cut Parameterized by Crossing Number,"Markus Chimani, Christine Dahn, Martina Juhnke-Kubitzke, Nils M. Kriege, Petra Mutzel, Alexander Nover","Given an edge-weighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes, the NP-hard Max-Cut problem

$p$ is the polynomial running time for planar Max-Cut. The only previously
known similar algorithm [8] is restricted to 1-planar graphs (i.e., at most one

Routing-Based Delivery in Combination-Type Networks with Random Topology,"Mozhgan Bayat, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire","The coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) transmits

connected to a random subset of relays. This topology can be considered as a
generalized version of a celebrated family of networks, referred to as
combination networks. Our approach is simply based on routing MAN packets
through the network. The optimization of the routing can be formulated as a

Are My Invariants Valid? A Learning Approach,"Vincent J. Hellendoorn, Premkumar T. Devanbu, Oleksandr Polozov, Mark Marron","Ensuring that a program operates correctly is a difficult task in large,
complex systems. Enshrining invariants -- desired properties of correct
execution -- in code or comments can support maintainability and help sustain
correctness. Tools that can automatically infer and recommend invariants can
thus be very beneficial. However, current invariant-suggesting tools, such as
Daikon, suffer from high rates of false positives, in part because they only
leverage traced program values from available test cases, rather than directly
exploiting knowledge of the source code per se. We propose a machine-learning
approach to judging the validity of invariants, specifically of method pre- and
post-conditions, based directly on a method's source code. We introduce a new,
scalable approach to creating labeled invariants: using programs with large
test-suites, we generate Daikon invariants using traces from subsets of these
test-suites, and then label these as valid/invalid by cross-validating them
with held-out tests. This process induces a large set of labels that provide a
form of noisy supervision, which is then used to train a deep neural model,
based on gated graph neural networks. Our model learns to map the lexical,
syntactic, and semantic structure of a given method's body into a probability
that a candidate pre- or post-condition on that method's body is correct and is
able to accurately label invariants based on the noisy signal, even in
cross-project settings. Most importantly, it performs well on a hand-curated
dataset of invariants.",Software Engineering (cs.SE),,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 15 Mar 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Multi-Robot Routing for Persistent Monitoring with Latency Constraints,"Ahmad Bilal Asghar, Stephen L. Smith, Shreyas Sundaram","In this paper we study a multi-robot path planning problem for persistent

latency, and the objective is to find the minimum number of robots that can
satisfy these latency constraints. The decision version of this problem is
known to be PSPACE-complete. We present a $O(\log \rho)$ approximation
algorithm for the problem where $\rho$ is the ratio of the maximum and the

Deep Residual Autoencoder for quality independent JPEG restoration,"Simone Zini, Simone Bianco, Raimondo Schettini","In this paper we propose a deep residual autoencoder exploiting
Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB) to remove artifacts in JPEG compressed
images that is independent from the Quality Factor (QF) used. The proposed
approach leverages both the learning capacity of deep residual networks and
prior knowledge of the JPEG compression pipeline. The proposed model operates
in the YCbCr color space and performs JPEG artifact restoration in two phases
using two different autoencoders: the first one restores the luma channel
exploiting 2D convolutions; the second one, using the restored luma channel as
a guide, restores the chroma channels explotining 3D convolutions. Extensive
experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets (i.e. LIVE1,
BDS500, and CLASSIC-5) show that our model is able to outperform the state of
the art with respect to all the evaluation metrics considered (i.e. PSNR,
PSNR-B, and SSIM). This results is remarkable since the approaches in the state
of the art use a different set of weights for each compression quality, while
the proposed model uses the same weights for all of them, making it applicable
to images in the wild where the QF used for compression is unkwnown.
Furthermore, the proposed model shows a greater robustness than

Correct Approximation of IEEE 754 Floating-Point Arithmetic for Program Verification,"Roberto Bagnara, Abramo Bagnara, Fabio Biselli, Michele Chiari, Roberta Gori","Verification of programs using floating-point arithmetic is challenging on
several accounts. One of the difficulties of reasoning about such programs is
due to the peculiarities of floating-point arithmetic: rounding errors,
infinities, non-numeric objects (NaNs), signed zeroes, denormal numbers,
different rounding modes.... One possibility to reason about floating-point
arithmetic is to model a program computation path by means of a set of ternary
constraints of the form z = x op y and use constraint propagation techniques to
infer new information on the variables' possible values. In this setting, we
define and prove the correctness of algorithms to precisely bound the value of
one of the variables x, y or z, starting from the bounds known for the other

Arbitrage with Power Factor Correction using Energy Storage,"Md Umar Hashmi, Deepjyoti Deka, Ana Busic, Lucas Pereira, Scott Backhaus","The importance of reactive power compensation for power factor (PF)

relaxation along with penalty-based schemes. Using numerical simulations on
real data and realistic storage profiles, we show that energy storage can
correct PF locally without reducing arbitrage profit. It is observed that
active and reactive power control is largely decoupled in nature for performing
arbitrage and PF correction (PFC). Furthermore, we consider a real-time
implementation of the problem with uncertain load, renewable and pricing
profiles. We develop a model predictive control based storage control policy

Compression and Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks via Tucker Tensor Layer: From First Principles to Tensor Valued Back-Propagation,"Giuseppe G. Calvi, Ahmad Moniri, Mahmoud Mahfouz, Qibin Zhao, Danilo P. Mandic","This work aims to help resolve the two main stumbling blocks in the
application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), that is, the exceedingly large
number of trainable parameters and their physical interpretability. This is
achieved through a tensor valued approach, based on the proposed Tucker Tensor
Layer (TTL), as an alternative to the dense weight-matrices of DNNs. This
allows us to treat the weight-matrices of general DNNs as a matrix unfolding of
a higher order weight-tensor. By virtue of the compression properties of tensor
decompositions, this enables us to introduce a novel and efficient framework
for exploiting the multi-way nature of the weight-tensor in order to
dramatically reduce the number of DNN parameters. We also derive the tensor
valued back-propagation algorithm within the TTL framework, by extending the
notion of matrix derivatives to tensors. In this way, the physical
interpretability of the Tucker decomposition is exploited to gain physical
insights into the NN training, through the process of computing gradients with
respect to each factor matrix. The proposed framework is validated on both
synthetic data, and the benchmark datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10.
Overall, through the ability to provide the relative importance of each data
feature in training, the TTL back-propagation is shown to help mitigate the
""black-box"" nature inherent to NNs. Experiments also illustrate that the TTL
achieves a 66.63-fold compression on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, while, by

Deep Switch Networks for Generating Discrete Data and Language,"Payam Delgosha, Naveen Goela","Multilayer switch networks are proposed as artificial generators of
high-dimensional discrete data (e.g., binary vectors, categorical data, natural

deconvolution networks which generate continuous-valued data and which consist

are composed of adaptive switches which model conditional distributions of
discrete random variables. An interpretable, statistical framework is
introduced for training these nonlinear networks based on a maximum-likelihood
objective function. To learn network parameters, stochastic gradient descent is
applied to the objective. This direct optimization is stable until convergence,
and does not involve back-propagation over separate encoder and decoder
networks, or adversarial training of dueling networks. While training remains
tractable for moderately sized networks, Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
approximations of gradients are derived for deep networks which contain latent

LiDAR-Camera Calibration under Arbitrary Configurations: Observability and Methods,"Bo Fu, Yue Wang, Xiaqing Ding, Yanmei Jiao, Li Tang, Rong Xiong","LiDAR-camera calibration is a precondition for many heterogeneous systems
that fuse data from LiDAR and camera. However, the constraint from common field
of view and the requirement for strict time synchronization make the
calibration a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
LiDAR-camera calibration method aiming to eliminate these two constraints.
Specifically, we capture a scan of 3D LiDAR when both the environment and the
sensors are stationary, then move the camera to reconstruct the 3D environment
using the sequentially obtained images. Finally, we align 3D visual points to
the laser scan based on tightly couple graph optimization method to calculate
the extrinsic parameters between LiDAR and camera. Under this design, the
configuration of these two sensors are free from the common field of view
constraint owing to the extended view from the moving camera. And we also
eliminate the requirement for strict time synchronization as we only use the
single scan of laser data when the sensors are stationary. We theoretically
derive the conditions of minimal observability for our method and prove that
the accuracy of calibration is improved by collecting more observations from
multiple scattered calibration targets. We validate our method on both
simulation platform and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our method
achieves higher accuracy than other comparable methods, which is in accordance

Looking for the Devil in the Details: Learning Trilinear Attention Sampling Network for Fine-grained Image Recognition,"Heliang Zheng, Jianlong Fu, Zheng-Jun Zha, Jiebo Luo","Learning subtle yet discriminative features (e.g., beak and eyes for a bird)
plays a significant role in fine-grained image recognition. Existing
attention-based approaches localize and amplify significant parts to learn
fine-grained details, which often suffer from a limited number of parts and
heavy computational cost. In this paper, we propose to learn such fine-grained
features from hundreds of part proposals by Trilinear Attention Sampling
Network (TASN) in an efficient teacher-student manner. Specifically, TASN
consists of 1) a trilinear attention module, which generates attention maps by
modeling the inter-channel relationships, 2) an attention-based sampler which
highlights attended parts with high resolution, and 3) a feature distiller,
which distills part features into a global one by weight sharing and feature
preserving strategies. Extensive experiments verify that TASN yields the best

Deep Reinforcement Learning with Feedback-based Exploration,"Jan Scholten, Daan Wout, Carlos Celemin, Jens Kober","Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the control of increasingly complex

learning. The uncertainty in the policy and the corrective feedback is combined
directly in the action space as probabilistic conditional exploration. As a
result, the greatest part of the otherwise ignorant learning process can be
avoided. We demonstrate the proposed method, Predictive Probabilistic Merging
of Policies (PPMP), in combination with DDPG. In experiments on continuous

Episodic Memory Reader: Learning What to Remember for Question Answering from Streaming Data,"Moonsu Han, Minki Kang, Hyunwoo Jung, Sung Ju Hwang","We consider a novel question answering (QA) task where the machine needs to
read from large streaming data (long documents or videos) without knowing when
the questions will be given, which is difficult to solve with existing QA
methods due to their lack of scalability. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel end-to-end deep network model for reading comprehension, which we refer
to as Episodic Memory Reader (EMR) that sequentially reads the input contexts
into an external memory, while replacing memories that are less important for
answering \emph{unseen} questions. Specifically, we train an RL agent to
replace a memory entry when the memory is full, in order to maximize its QA
accuracy at a future timepoint, while encoding the external memory using either
the GRU or the Transformer architecture to learn representations that considers
relative importance between the memory entries. We validate our model on a
synthetic dataset (bAbI) as well as real-world large-scale textual QA

start of each episode, thereby allowing it to learn a context-dependent
near-optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a no-regret online RL algorithm
in the setting where the MDP parameters are obtained from the context using
generalized linear mappings (GLMs). We propose and analyze optimistic and
randomized exploration methods which make (time and space) efficient online

Teaching with IMPACT,"Carl Trimbach, Michael Littman","Like many problems in AI in their general form, supervised learning is
computationally intractable. We hypothesize that an important reason humans can
learn highly complex and varied concepts, in spite of the computational
difficulty, is that they benefit tremendously from experienced and insightful
teachers. This paper proposes a new learning framework that provides a role for
a knowledgeable, benevolent teacher to guide the process of learning a target
concept in a series of ""curricular"" phases or rounds. In each round, the
teacher's role is to act as a moderator, exposing the learner to a subset of
the available training data to move it closer to mastering the target concept.
Via both theoretical and empirical evidence, we argue that this framework
enables simple, efficient learners to acquire very complex concepts from
examples. In particular, we provide multiple examples of concept classes that
are known to be unlearnable in the standard PAC setting along with provably
efficient algorithms for learning them in our extended setting. A key focus of
our work is the ability to learn complex concepts on top of simpler, previously

"Low Field-size, Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes for Channels With Burst and Random Erasures","M. Nikhil Krishnan, Deeptanshu Shukla, P. Vijay Kumar","In this paper, we design erasure-correcting codes for channels with burst and
random erasures, when a strict decoding delay constraint is in place. We
consider the sliding-window-based packet erasure model proposed by Badr et al.,
where any time-window of width $w$ contains either up to $a$ random erasures or
an erasure burst of length at most $b$. One needs to recover any erased packet,
where erasures are as per the channel model, with a strict decoding delay
deadline of $\tau$ time slots. Presently existing rate-optimal constructions in
the literature require, in general, a field-size which grows exponential in
$\tau$, for a constant $\frac{a}{\tau}$. In this work, we present a new
rate-optimal code construction covering all channel and delay parameters, which
requires an $O(\tau^2)$ field-size. As a special case, when $(b-a)=1$, we have
a field-size linear in $\tau$. We also present three other constructions having
linear field-size, under certain constraints on channel and decoding delay
parameters. As a corollary, we obtain low field-size, rate-optimal
convolutional codes for any given column distance and column span. Simulations
indicate that the newly proposed streaming code constructions offer lower

"Architecture-Aware, High Performance Transaction for Persistent Memory","Kai Wu, Jie Ren, Dong Li","Byte-addressable non-volatile main memory (NVM) demands transactional
mechanisms to access and manipulate data on NVM atomically. Those transaction
mechanisms often employ a logging mechanism (undo logging or redo logging).
However, the logging mechanisms can bring large runtime overhead (8%-49% in our
evaluation), and 41%-78% of the overhead attributes to the frequent cache-line
flushing. Such large overhead significantly diminishes the performance benefits
offered by NVM. In this paper, we introduce a new method to reduce the overhead
of cache-line flushing for logging-based transactions. Different from the
traditional method that works at the program level and leverages program
semantics to reduce the logging overhead, we introduce architecture awareness.
In particular, we do not flush certain cache blocks, as long as they are
estimated to be eliminated out of the cache because of the hardware caching
mechanism (e.g., the cache replacement algorithm). Furthermore, we coalesce
those cache blocks with low dirtiness to improve the efficiency of cache-line
flushing. We implement an architecture-aware, high performance transaction
runtime system for persistent memory, Archapt. Our results show that comparing
with an undo logging (PMDK) and a redo logging (Mnemosyne), Archapt reduces
cache-line flushing by 66% and improves system throughput by 19% on average
(42% at most). Our crash tests with four hardware caching policies show that
Archapt provides a strong guarantee on crash consistency.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,"[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 18 Apr 2019 (this version, v2)]"

Improving Neural Architecture Search Image Classifiers via Ensemble Learning,"Vladimir Macko, Charles Weill, Hanna Mazzawi, Javier Gonzalvo","Finding the best neural network architecture requires significant time,
resources, and human expertise. These challenges are partially addressed by
neural architecture search (NAS) which is able to find the best convolutional
layer or cell that is then used as a building block for the network. However,
once a good building block is found, manual design is still required to
assemble the final architecture as a combination of multiple blocks under a
predefined parameter budget constraint. A common solution is to stack these
blocks into a single tower and adjust the width and depth to fill the parameter
budget. However, these single tower architectures may not be optimal. Instead,
in this paper we present the AdaNAS algorithm, that uses ensemble techniques to
compose a neural network as an ensemble of smaller networks automatically.
Additionally, we introduce a novel technique based on knowledge distillation to
iteratively train the smaller networks using the previous ensemble as a
teacher. Our experiments demonstrate that ensembles of networks improve

A Formal Verification Technique for Architecture-based Embedded Systems in EAST-ADL,Eun-Young Kang,"Development of quality assured software-intensive systems, such as automotive

"Learning Representations from Persian Handwriting for Offline Signature Verification, a Deep Transfer Learning Approach","Omid Mersa, Farhood Etaati, Saeed Masoudnia, Babak N. Araabi","Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a challenging pattern recognition
task, especially when it is expected to generalize well on the skilled

include small training sample and large intra-class variations. Considering the
limitations, we suggest a novel transfer learning approach from Persian
handwriting domain to multi-language OSV domain. We train two Residual CNNs on
the source domain separately based on two different tasks of word
classification and writer identification. Since identifying a person signature
resembles identifying ones handwriting, it seems perfectly convenient to use
handwriting for the feature learning phase. The learned representation on the
more varied and plentiful handwriting dataset can compensate for the lack of
training data in the original task, i.e. OSV, without sacrificing the
generalizability. Our proposed OSV system includes two steps: learning
representation and verification of the input signature. For the first step, the
signature images are fed into the trained Residual CNNs. The output
representations are then used to train SVMs for the verification. We test our
OSV system on three different signature datasets, including MCYT (a Spanish

resulting flow field of the CNN resembled the ground truth accurately with an
endpoint-error percentage between 6.5\% to 14.5\%. Furthermore, when confronted

Learning Robust Representations by Projecting Superficial Statistics Out,"Haohan Wang, Zexue He, Zachary C. Lipton, Eric P. Xing","Despite impressive performance as evaluated on i.i.d. holdout data, deep
neural networks depend heavily on superficial statistics of the training data
and are liable to break under distribution shift. For example, subtle changes
to the background or texture of an image can break a seemingly powerful
classifier. Building on previous work on domain generalization, we hope to
produce a classifier that will generalize to previously unseen domains, even
when domain identifiers are not available during training. This setting is
challenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific
(superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals.
To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix
(GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial:
they are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an
image. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks'
out-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient
method that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM
representation is not predictable. The second method is built on the
independence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the
subspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's. We test our method on the battery
of standard domain generalization data sets and, interestingly, achieve
comparable or better performance as compared to other domain generalization
methods that explicitly require samples from the target distribution for

and standard-dose CT (SDCT) images, where the denoising function is the optimal
generator in the GAN framework. This paper analyzes the f-GAN objective to
derive a suitable generator that is optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of
two losses: the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an SDCT data distribution
and a generated distribution, and the $\ell_2$ loss between the LDCT image and
the corresponding generated images (or denoised image). The computed generator
reflects the prior belief about SDCT data distribution through training. We
observed that the proposed method allows the preservation of fine anomalous

Hyperspectral Image Classification with Deep Metric Learning and Conditional Random Field,"Yi Liang, Xin Zhao, Alan J.X. Guo, Fei Zhu","To improve the classification performance in the context of hyperspectral
image processing, many works have been developed based on two common
strategies, namely the spatial-spectral information integration and the
utilization of neural networks. However, both strategies typically require more
training data than the classical algorithms, aggregating the shortage of
labeled samples. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that organically
combines the spectrum-based deep metric learning model and the conditional
random field algorithm. The deep metric learning model is supervised by the
center loss to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly in
Euclidean space within classes. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge
potentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation tasks, is
introduced to give the pixel-wise classification over the hyperspectral image
by utilizing both the geographical distances between pixels and the Euclidean
distances between the features produced by the deep metric learning model. The
proposed framework is trained by spectral pixels at the deep metric learning
stage and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional
random field stage. This settlement alleviates the shortage of training data to
some extent. Experiments on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate the

Mixture Modeling of Global Shape Priors and Autoencoding Local Intensity Priors for Left Atrium Segmentation,"Tim Sodergren, Riddhish Bhalodia, Ross Whitaker, Joshua Cates, Nassir Marrouche, Shireen Elhabian","Difficult image segmentation problems, for instance left atrium MRI, can be
addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent
with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an
adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the
prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more
general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious
challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we
propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image
model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use
deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding
the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as
a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a
high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional
subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a
latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized
expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based
scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific
shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and
an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a
nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our
approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is

Graph Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (GHCRNN) for Vehicle Condition Prediction,"Mingming Lu, Kunfang Zhang, Haiying Liu, Naixue Xiong","The prediction of urban vehicle flow and speed can greatly facilitate
people's travel, and also can provide reasonable advice for the decision-making
of relevant government departments. However, due to the spatial, temporal and
hierarchy of vehicle flow and many influencing factors such as weather, it is
difficult to prediction. Most of the existing research methods are to extract
spatial structure information on the road network and extract time series
information from the historical data. However, when extracting spatial
features, these methods have higher time and space complexity, and incorporate
a lot of noise. It is difficult to apply on large graphs, and only considers
the influence of surrounding connected road nodes on the central node, ignoring
a very important hierarchical relationship, namely, similar information of
similar node features and road network structures. In response to these
problems, this paper proposes the Graph Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent

cooperative multi-agent positioning problem where each agent performs
single-agent positioning until it encounters some other agent. Upon the
encounter, the two agents measure their relative pose, and exchange particle
clouds representing their poses. We propose a cooperative positioning algorithm
which fuses the received information with the locally available measurements
and infers an agent's pose within Bayesian framework. The algorithm is scalable
to multiple agents, has relatively low computational complexity, admits
decentralized implementation across agents, and imposes relatively mild
requirements on communication coverage and bandwidth. The experiments indicate
that the proposed algorithm considerably improves single-agent positioning
accuracy, reduces the convergence time of a particle cloud and, unlike its
single-agent positioning counterpart, exhibits immunity to an impeding
feature-scarce and symmetric environment layout.",Robotics (cs.RO),,[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]
DysLexML: Screening Tool for Dyslexia Using Machine Learning,"Thomais Asvestopoulou, Victoria Manousaki, Antonis Psistakis, Ioannis Smyrnakis, Vassilios Andreadakis, Ioannis M. Aslanides, Maria Papadopouli","Eye movements during text reading can provide insights about reading
disorders. Via eye-trackers, we can measure when, where and how eyes move with
relation to the words they read. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can decode
this information and provide differential analysis. This work developed
DysLexML, a screening tool for developmental dyslexia that applies various ML
algorithms to analyze fixation points recorded via eye-tracking during silent
reading of children. It comparatively evaluated its performance using
measurements collected in a systematic field study with 69 native Greek
speakers, children, 32 of which were diagnosed as dyslexic by the official
governmental agency for diagnosing learning and reading difficulties in Greece.
We examined a large set of features based on statistical properties of
fixations and saccadic movements and identified the ones with prominent
predictive power, performing dimensionality reduction. Specifically, DysLexML
achieves its best performance using linear SVM, with an a accuracy of 97 %,
with a small feature set, namely saccade length, number of short forward
movements, and number of multiply fixated words. Furthermore, we analyzed the
impact of noise on the fixation positions and showed that DysLexML is accurate
and robust in the presence of noise. These encouraging results set the basis
for developing screening tools in less controlled, larger-scale environments,
with inexpensive eye-trackers, potentially reaching a larger population for

Syntgen: A system to generate temporal networks with user specified topology,"Luis Ramada Pereira, Rui J. Lopes, Jorge Louçã","Network representations can help reveal the behavior of complex systems.
Useful information can be derived from the network properties and invariants,
such as components, clusters or cliques, as well as from their changes over
time. The evolution of clusters of nodes (or communities) is one of the major
focus of research. However, the time dimension increases complexity,
introducing new constructs and requiring novel and enhanced algorithms. In
spite of recent improvements, the relative scarcity of timestamped
representations of empiric networks, with known ground truth, hinders algorithm
validation. A few approaches have been proposed to generate synthetic temporal
networks that conform to static topological specifications while in general
adopting an ad-hoc approach to temporal evolution. We believe there is still a
need for a principled synthetic network generator that conforms to problem
domain topological specifications from a static as well as temporal
perspective. Here we present such a system. The unique attributes of our system
include accepting arbitrary node degree and cluster size distributions and
temporal evolution under user control, while supporting tunable joint
distribution and temporal correlation of node degrees. Theoretical
contributions include the analysis of conditions for ""graphability"" of
sequences of inter and intra cluster node degrees and cluster sizes and the
development of a heuristic to search for the cluster membership of nodes that
minimizes the shared information distance between clusterings. Our work shows
that this system is capable of generating networks under user controlled
topology with up to thousands of nodes and hundreds of clusters with strong
topology adherence. Much larger networks are possible with relaxed
requirements. The generated networks support algorithm validation as well as

Theories of Parenting and their Application to Artificial Intelligence,"Sky Croeser, Peter Eckersley","As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power
over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have
become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades,
humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that
thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of
humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely
debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but
increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations.
Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We
think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically
radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents
whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily
be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles
which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research,

Optimal Price of Anarchy in Cost-Sharing Games,"Rahul Chandan, Dario Paccagnan, Jason R. Marden","The design of distributed algorithms is central to the study of multiagent
systems control. In this paper, we consider a class of combinatorial
cost-minimization problems and propose a framework for designing distributed
algorithms with a priori performance guarantees that are near-optimal. We
approach this problem from a game-theoretic perspective, assigning agents cost
functions such that the equilibrium efficiency (price of anarchy) is optimized.
Once agents' cost functions have been specified, any algorithm capable of
computing a Nash equilibrium of the system inherits a performance guarantee
matching the price of anarchy. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem of
computing the price of anarchy as a tractable linear program. We then present a
framework for designing agents' local cost functions in order to optimize for
the worst-case equilibrium efficiency. Finally, we investigate the implications

Fast Algorithms for the Shortest Unique Palindromic Substring Problem on Run-Length Encoded Strings,"Kiichi Watanabe, Yuto Nakashima, Shunsuke Inenaga, Hideo Bannai, Masayuki Takeda","For a string $S$, a palindromic substring $S[i..j]$ is said to be a

shorter than $S[i..j]$ occurs at least twice in $S$. In this paper, we study
the problem of answering $\mathit{SUPS}$ queries on run-length encoded strings.
We show how to preprocess a given run-length encoded string $\mathit{RLE}_{S}$

A Research Agenda: Dynamic Models to Defend Against Correlated Attacks,Ian Goodfellow,"In this article I describe a research agenda for securing machine learning
models against adversarial inputs at test time. This article does not present
results but instead shares some of my thoughts about where I think that the
field needs to go. Modern machine learning works very well on I.I.D. data: data
for which each example is drawn {\em independently} and for which the
distribution generating each example is {\em identical}. When these assumptions
are relaxed, modern machine learning can perform very poorly. When machine
learning is used in contexts where security is a concern, it is desirable to
design models that perform well even when the input is designed by a malicious
adversary. So far most research in this direction has focused on an adversary
who violates the {\em identical} assumption, and imposes some kind of
restricted worst-case distribution shift. I argue that machine learning
security researchers should also address the problem of relaxing the {\em
independence} assumption and that current strategies designed for robustness to
distribution shift will not do so. I recommend {\em dynamic models} that change
each time they are run as a potential solution path to this problem, and show
an example of a simple attack using correlated data that can be mitigated by a
simple dynamic defense. This is not intended as a real-world security measure,
but as a recommendation to explore this research direction and develop more
realistic defenses.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]

Pose Graph Optimization for Unsupervised Monocular Visual Odometry,"Yang Li, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Tatsuya Harada","Unsupervised Learning based monocular visual odometry (VO) has lately drawn
significant attention for its potential in label-free leaning ability and
robustness to camera parameters and environmental variations. However,
partially due to the lack of drift correction technique, these methods are
still by far less accurate than geometric approaches for large-scale odometry
estimation. In this paper, we propose to leverage graph optimization and loop
closure detection to overcome limitations of unsupervised learning based
monocular visual odometry. To this end, we propose a hybrid VO system which
combines an unsupervised monocular VO called NeuralBundler with a pose graph
optimization back-end. NeuralBundler is a neural network architecture that uses
temporal and spatial photometric loss as main supervision and generates a
windowed pose graph consists of multi-view 6DoF constraints. We propose a novel
pose cycle consistency loss to relieve the tensions in the windowed pose graph,
leading to improved performance and robustness. In the back-end, a global pose
graph is built from local and loop 6DoF constraints estimated by NeuralBundler
and is optimized over SE(3). Empirical evaluation on the KITTI odometry dataset

DF-camera with a fisheye lens for telepresence robots. We aim at providing more
compact and efficient visual feedback for the user interface of telepresence
robots with user-friendly interactive experiences. To this end, we present a
multi-homography-based video stitching method which stitches videos from a

alignment, seam cutting, and image blending. We directly align the wide-angle
video image and the fisheye video image based on the multi-homography alignment
without calibration, distortion correction, and unwarping procedures. Thus, we
can obtain a stitched video with shape preservation in the non-overlapping
regions and alignment in the overlapping area for telepresence. To alleviate
ghosting effects caused by moving objects and/or moving cameras during
telepresence robot driving, an optimal seam is found for aligned video
composition, and the optimal seam will be updated in subsequent frames,
considering spatial and temporal coherence. The final stitched video is created
by image blending based on the optimal seam. We conducted a user study to

to learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by
exploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft
multilabels of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are cross-view

the learning goal that the soft multilabels are consistently good across
different camera views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we

Co-Contagion Diffusion on Multilayer Networks,"Ho-Chun Herbert Chang, Feng Fu","This study examines the interface of three elements during co-contagion
diffusion: the \textbf{synergy} between contagions, the \textbf{dormancy} rate

Dormancy is defined as a weaker form of ""immunity,"" where dormant nodes no

infection. The proposed model extends the literature on threshold models, and
demonstrates intricate interdependencies between different graph structures.
Our simulations show that first, the faster contagion induces branching on the
slower contagion; second, shorter characteristic path lengths diminish the
impact of dormancy in lowering diffusion. Third, when two long-range graphs are
paired, the faster contagion depends on both dormancy rates, whereas the slower
contagion depends only on its own; fourth, synergistic contagions are less
sensitive to dormancy, and have a wider window to diffuse. Furthermore, when
long-range and spatially constrained graphs are paired, ring vaccination occurs
on the spatial graph and produces partial diffusion, due to dormant,
surrounding nodes. The spatial contagion depends on both dormancy rates whereas

Time Reversal based MAC for Multi-Hop Underwater Acoustic Networks,"Ruiqin Zhao, Hao Long, Octavia A. Dobre, Xiaohong Shen, Telex M. N. Ngatched, Haodi Mei","Constrained-energy underwater acoustic nodes are typically connected via a
multi-hop underwater acoustic network (MHUAN) to cover a broad marine region.
Recently, protocols for efficiently connecting such nodes have received
considerable attention. In this paper, we show that the time reversal (TR)
process plays an important role in the medium access control (MAC) because of
its physical capability to exploit the multi-path energy from the richly
scattering underwater environment, as well as to focus the signal energy in
both spatial and temporal domains. In MHUANs, with severe multi-path
propagation at the physical layer, the active TR process spatially focuses the
signals to the location of the intended receiver; this significantly diminishes
the interference among parallel links. We propose an active TR-based MAC
protocol for MHUANs, with the aim of minimizing collision and maximizing
channel utilization simultaneously. Furthermore, by considering the impact of
the cross-correlation between different links on the TR-based medium access, we
derive the threshold of the link cross-correlation to resolve collision caused
by the high cross-correlation between realistic links. We perform simulations

Turbo Learning Framework for Human-Object Interactions Recognition and Human Pose Estimation,"Wei Feng, Wentao Liu, Tong Li, Jing Peng, Chen Qian, Xiaolin Hu","Human-object interactions (HOI) recognition and pose estimation are two
closely related tasks. Human pose is an essential cue for recognizing actions
and localizing the interacted objects. Meanwhile, human action and their
interacted objects' localizations provide guidance for pose estimation. In this
paper, we propose a turbo learning framework to perform HOI recognition and
pose estimation simultaneously. First, two modules are designed to enforce
message passing between the tasks, i.e. pose aware HOI recognition module and
HOI guided pose estimation module. Then, these two modules form a closed loop
to utilize the complementary information iteratively, which can be trained in
an end-to-end manner. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on two public benchmarks including Verbs in COCO (V-COCO) and

Deterministic Approximation of Random Walks in Small Space,"Jack Murtagh, Omer Reingold, Aaron Sidford, Salil Vadhan","We give a deterministic, nearly logarithmic-space algorithm that given an
undirected graph $G$, a positive integer $r$, and a set $S$ of vertices,
approximates the conductance of $S$ in the $r$-step random walk on $G$ to
within a factor of $1+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon>0$ is an arbitrarily small
constant. More generally, our algorithm computes an $\epsilon$-spectral
approximation to the normalized Laplacian of the $r$-step walk.
Our algorithm combines the derandomized square graph operation (Rozenman and
Vadhan, 2005), which we recently used for solving Laplacian systems in nearly
logarithmic space (Murtagh, Reingold, Sidford, and Vadhan, 2017), with ideas
from (Cheng, Cheng, Liu, Peng, and Teng, 2015), which gave an algorithm that is
time-efficient (while ours is space-efficient) and randomized (while ours is
deterministic) for the case of even $r$ (while ours works for all $r$). Along
the way, we provide some new results that generalize technical machinery and
yield improvements over previous work. First, we obtain a nearly linear-time
randomized algorithm for computing a spectral approximation to the normalized
Laplacian for odd $r$. Second, we define and analyze a generalization of the
derandomized square for irregular graphs and for sparsifying the product of two
distinct graphs. As part of this generalization, we also give a strongly

Herding an Adversarial Attacker to a Safe Area for Defending Safety-Critical Infrastructure,"Vishnu S Chipade, Dimitra Panagou","This paper investigates a problem of defending safety-critical infrastructure
from an adversarial aerial attacker in an urban environment. A circular arc
formation of defenders is formed around the attacker, and vector-field based
guidance laws herd the attacker to a predefined safe area in the presence of
rectangular obstacles. The defenders' formation is defined based on a novel
vector field that imposes super-elliptic contours around the obstacles, to
closely resemble their rectangular shape. A novel finite-time stabilizing

avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions. The efficiency of the approach

Fast influencers in complex networks,"Fang Zhou, Linyuan Lü, Manuel Sebastian Mariani","Influential nodes in complex networks are typically defined as those nodes
that maximize the asymptotic reach of a spreading process of interest. However,
for practical applications such as viral marketing and online information
spreading, one is often interested in maximizing the reach of the process in a
short amount of time. The traditional definition of influencers in
network-related studies from diverse research fields narrows down the focus to
the late-time state of the spreading processes, leaving the following question
unsolved: which nodes are able to initiate large-scale spreading processes, in
a limited amount of time? Here, we find that there is a fundamental difference
between the nodes -- which we call ""fast influencers"" -- that initiate the
largest-reach processes in a short amount of time, and the traditional,
""late-time"" influencers. Stimulated by this observation, we provide an
extensive benchmarking of centrality metrics with respect to their ability to
identify both the fast and late-time influencers. We find that local network
properties can be used to uncover the fast influencers. In particular, a
parsimonious, local centrality metric (which we call social capital) achieves
optimal or nearly-optimal performance in the fast influencer identification for
all the analyzed empirical networks. Local metrics tend to be also competitive
in the traditional, late-time influencer identification task.",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),; Computers and Society (cs.CY); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph),[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]
Robust Decidability of Sampled-Data Control of Nonlinear Systems with Temporal Logic Specifications,Jun Liu,"This paper explores the theoretical limits of using discrete abstractions for
nonlinear control synthesis. More specifically, we consider the problem of
deciding continuous-time control with temporal logic specifications. We prove
that sampled-data control of nonlinear systems with temporal logic
specifications is robustly decidable in the sense that, given a continuous-time
nonlinear control system and a temporal logic formula, one can algorithmically
decide whether there exists a robust sampled-data control strategy to realize
this specification when the right-hand side of the system is slightly perturbed
by a small disturbance. If the answer is positive, one can then construct a
(potentially less) robust sampled-data control strategy that realizes the same
specification. The result is proved by constructing a robustly complete
abstraction of the original continuous-time control system using sufficiently
small discretization parameters. We illustrate the result with a nonlinear
control example.",Systems and Control (eess.SY),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

Enabling Spike-based Backpropagation for Training Deep Neural Network Architectures,"Chankyu Lee, Syed Shakib Sarwar, Priyadarshini Panda, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan, Kaushik Roy","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as a prominent neural
computing paradigm. However, the typical shallow SNN architectures have limited
capacity for expressing complex representations while training deep SNNs using
input spikes has not been successful so far. Diverse methods have been proposed
to get around this issue such as converting off-the-shelf trained deep
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs. However, the ANN-SNN conversion
scheme fails to capture the temporal dynamics of a spiking system. On the other
hand, it is still a difficult problem to directly train deep SNNs using input
spike events due to the discontinuous, non-differentiable nature of the spike
generation function. To overcome this problem, we propose an approximate
derivative method that accounts for the leaky behavior of LIF neurons. This
method enables training deep convolutional SNNs directly (with input spike
events) using spike-based backpropagation. Our experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed spike-based learning on deep networks (VGG and
Residual architectures) by achieving the best classification accuracies in
MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets compared to other SNNs trained with a

Pricing and Routing Mechanisms for Differentiated Services in an Electric Vehicle Public Charging Station Network,"Ahmadreza Moradipari, Mahnoosh Alizadeh","We consider a Charging Network Operator (CNO) that owns a network of Electric
Vehicle (EV) public charging stations and wishes to offer a menu of
differentiated service options for access to its stations. This involves
designing optimal pricing and routing schemes for the setting where users
cannot directly choose which station they use. Instead, they choose their
priority level and energy request amount from the differentiated service menu,
and then the CNO directly assigns them to a station on their path. This allows
higher priority users to experience lower wait times at stations, and allows
the CNO to directly manage demand, exerting a higher level of control that can
be used to manage the effect of EV on the grid and control station wait times.
We consider the scenarios where the CNO is a social welfare-maximizing or a

Did You Miss the Sign? A False Negative Alarm System for Traffic Sign Detectors,"Quazi Marufur Rahman, Niko Sünderhauf, Feras Dayoub","Object detection is an integral part of an autonomous vehicle for its
safety-critical and navigational purposes. Traffic signs as objects play a
vital role in guiding such systems. However, if the vehicle fails to locate any
critical sign, it might make a catastrophic failure. In this paper, we propose
an approach to identify traffic signs that have been mistakenly discarded by
the object detector. The proposed method raises an alarm when it discovers a
failure by the object detector to detect a traffic sign. This approach can be
useful to evaluate the performance of the detector during the deployment phase.
We trained a single shot multi-box object detector to detect traffic signs and
used its internal features to train a separate false negative detector (FND).
During deployment, FND decides whether the traffic sign detector (TSD) has
missed a sign or not. We are using precision and recall to measure the accuracy
of FND in two different datasets. For 80% recall, FND has achieved 89.9%
precision in Belgium Traffic Sign Detection dataset and 90.8% precision in
German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset respectively. To the best of

Full Attitude Control of an Efficient Quadrotor Tail-sitter VTOL UAV with Flexible Modes,"Wei Xu, Haowei Gu, Youming Qing, Jiarong Lin, Fu Zhang","In this paper, we present a full attitude control of an efficient quadrotor

paper concentrates on the design of the attitude controller and the altitude
controller. For the attitude control, the controller's parameters and filters
are optimized based on the frequency response model which is identified from
the sweep experiment. As a result, the effect of system flexible modes is
easily compensated in frequency-domain by using a notch filter, and the
resulting attitude loop shows superior tracking performance and robustness. In
the coordinated flight condition, the altitude controller is structured as the

AccFlow: Defending Against the Low-Rate TCP DoS Attack in Wireless Sensor Networks,"Yuan Cao, Lijuan Han, Xiaojin Zhao, Xiaofang Pan","Because of the open nature of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), the Denial
of the Service (DoS) becomes one of the most serious threats to the stability
of the resourceconstrained sensor nodes. In this paper, we develop AccFlow
which is an incrementally deployable Software-Defined Networking based protocol
that is able to serve as a countermeasure against the low-rate TCP DoS attack.
The main idea of AccFlow is to make the attacking flows accountable for the
congestion by dropping their packets according to their loss rates. The larger
their loss rates, the more aggressively AccFlow drops their packets. Through
extensive simulations, we demonstrate that AccFlow can effectively defend
against the low-rate TCP DoS attack even if attackers vary their strategies by
attacking at different scales and data rates. Furthermore, while AccFlow is
designed to solve the low-rate TCP DoS attack, we demonstrate that AccFlow can
also effectively defend against general DoS attacks which do not rely on the
TCP retransmission timeout mechanism but cause denial of service to legitimate
users by consistently exhausting the network resources. Finally, we consider

Quality-aware Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation,"Lei Chen, Le Wu, Zhenzhen Hu, Meng Wang","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for the
image-to-image translation task. While these models rely heavily on the labeled
image pairs, recently some GAN variants have been proposed to tackle the
unpaired image translation task. These models exploited supervision at the
domain level with a reconstruction process for unpaired image translation. On
the other hand, parallel works have shown that leveraging perceptual loss
functions based on high level deep features could enhance the generated image
quality. Nevertheless, as these GAN-based models either depended on the
pretrained deep network structure or relied on the labeled image pairs, they
could not be directly applied to the unpaired image translation task. Moreover,
despite the improvement of the introduced perceptual losses from deep neural
networks, few researchers have explored the possibility of improving the
generated image quality from classical image quality measures. To tackle the
above two challenges, in this paper, we propose a unified quality-aware
GAN-based framework for unpaired image-to-image translation, where a
quality-aware loss is explicitly incorporated by comparing each source image
and the reconstructed image at the domain level. Specifically, we design two
detailed implementations of the quality loss. The first method is based on a
classical image quality assessment measure by defining a classical
quality-aware loss. The second method proposes an adaptive deep network based
loss. Finally, extensive experimental results on many real-world datasets
clearly show the quality improvement of our proposed framework, and the

Studying the Inductive Biases of RNNs with Synthetic Variations of Natural Languages,"Shauli Ravfogel, Yoav Goldberg, Tal Linzen","How do typological properties such as word order and morphological case
marking affect the ability of neural sequence models to acquire the syntax of a

languages differ in multiple typological properties, as well as by differences
in training corpus. We propose a paradigm that addresses these issues: we
create synthetic versions of English, which differ from English in one or more
typological parameters, and generate corpora for those languages based on a
parsed English corpus. We report a series of experiments in which RNNs were
trained to predict agreement features for verbs in each of those synthetic
languages. Among other findings, (1) performance was higher in
subject-verb-object order (as in English) than in subject-object-verb order (as
in Japanese), suggesting that RNNs have a recency bias; (2) predicting
agreement with both subject and object (polypersonal agreement) improves over
predicting each separately, suggesting that underlying syntactic knowledge
transfers across the two tasks; and (3) overt morphological case makes
agreement prediction significantly easier, regardless of word order.",Computation and Language (cs.CL),,"[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 26 Mar 2019 (this version, v2)]"

A Faster Algorithm Enumerating Relevant Features over Finite Fields,Mikito Nanashima,"We consider the problem of enumerating relevant features hidden in other
irrelevant information for multi-labeled data, which is formalized as learning
juntas.
A $k$-junta function is a function which depends on only $k$ coordinates of
the input. For relatively small $k$ w.r.t. the input size $n$, learning
$k$-junta functions is one of fundamental problems both theoretically and
practically in machine learning. For the last two decades, much effort has been
made to design efficient learning algorithms for Boolean junta functions, and
some novel techniques have been developed. However, in real world,
multi-labeled data seem to be obtained in much more often than binary-labeled
one. Thus, it is a natural question whether these techniques can be applied to
more general cases about the alphabet size.
In this paper, we expand the Fourier detection techniques for the binary
alphabet to any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and give, roughly speaking, an
$O(n^{0.8k})$-time learning algorithm for $k$-juntas over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Note
that our algorithm is the first non-trivial (i.e., non-brute force) algorithm
for such a class even in the case where $q=3$ and we give an affirmative answer
to the question posed by Mossel et al.
Our algorithm consists of two reductions: (1) from learning juntas to LDME
which is a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problems introduced by
Regev, and (2) from LDME to the light bulb problem (LBP) introduced by
L.Valiant. Since the reduced problem (i.e., LBP) is a kind of binary problem

juntas), we can directly apply the techniques for the binary case in the
previous work.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 14 Jul 2019 (this version, v2)]"
A proposed method to extract maximum possible power in the shortest time on solar PV arrays under partial shadings using metaheuristic algorithms,"Reza Hedayati Majdabadi, Saeed Sharifian Khortoomi","The increasing use of fossil fuels to produce energy is leading to
environmental problems. Hence, it has led the human society to move towards the
use of renewable energies, including solar energy. In recent years, one of the
most popular methods to gain energy is using photovoltaic arrays to produce
solar energy. Skyscrapers and different weather conditions cause shadings on
these PV arrays, which leads to less power generation. Various methods such as
TCT and Sudoku patterns have been proposed to improve power generation for
partial shading PV arrays, but these methods have some problems such as not
generating maximum power and being designed for a specific dimension of PV
arrays. Therefore, we proposed a metaheuristic algorithm-based approach to
extract maximum possible power in the shortest possible time. In this paper,
five algorithms which have proper results in most of the searching problems are
chosen from different groups of metaheuristic algorithms. Also, four different
standard shading patterns are used for more realistic analysis. Results show
that the proposed method achieves better results in maximum power generation
compared to TCT arrangement (18.53%) and Sudoku arrangement (4.93%). Also, the
results show that GWO is the fastest metaheuristic algorithm to reach maximum

Online Explanation Generation for Human-Robot Teaming,"Mehrdad Zakershahrak, Ze Gong, Nikhillesh Sadassivam, Yu Zhang","As AI becomes an integral part of our lives, the development of explainable
AI, embodied in the decision-making process of an AI or robotic agent, becomes
imperative. For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to
justify its behavior is one of the key requirements of explainable agency.
Prior work on explanation generation has been focused on supporting the
rationale behind the robot's decision or behavior. These approaches, however,
fail to consider the mental demand for understanding the received explanation.
In other words, the human teammate is expected to understand an explanation no
matter how much information is presented. In this work, we argue that
explanations, especially those of a complex nature, should be made in an online
fashion during the execution, which helps spread out the information to be
explained and thus reduce the mental workload of humans in highly cognitive
demanding tasks. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an
explanation may be dependent on each other, which must be taken into account
when generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of
online explanation generation is presented with three variations satisfying
different ""online"" properties. The new explanation generation methods are based
on a model reconciliation setting introduced in our prior work. We evaluated
our methods both with human subjects in a simulated rover domain, using NASA

partial caching bulk transmission (PCBT) and partial caching pipelined
transmission (PCPT) schemes. In the PCBT scheme, eRRHs first fetch the uncached
requested files from the baseband unit (BBU) and then all requested files are
simultaneously transmitted to the users. In the PCPT scheme, eRRHs first
transmit the cached requested files while fetching the uncached requested files
from the BBU. Then, the remaining cached requested files and fetched uncached
requested files are simultaneously transmitted to the users. The design goal of
the three transmission schemes is to minimize the delivery latency, subject to
some practical constraints. Efficient algorithms are developed for the
low-latency cloud-edge coordinated transmission strategies. Numerical results
are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed transmission schemes
and show that the PCPT scheme outperforms the PCBT scheme in terms of the
delivery latency criterion.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]
Applying Probabilistic Programming to Affective Computing,"Desmond C. Ong, Harold Soh, Jamil Zaki, Noah D. Goodman","Affective Computing is a rapidly growing field spurred by advancements in
artificial intelligence, but often, held back by the inability to translate
psychological theories of emotion into tractable computational models. To
address this, we propose a probabilistic programming approach to affective
computing, which models psychological-grounded theories as generative models of
emotion, and implements them as stochastic, executable computer programs. We
first review probabilistic approaches that integrate reasoning about emotions
with reasoning about other latent mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires) in
context. Recently-developed probabilistic programming languages offer several
key desidarata over previous approaches, such as: (i) flexibility in
representing emotions and emotional processes; (ii) modularity and
compositionality; (iii) integration with deep learning libraries that
facilitate efficient inference and learning from large, naturalistic data; and
(iv) ease of adoption. Furthermore, using a probabilistic programming framework
allows a standardized platform for theory-building and experimentation:
Competing theories (e.g., of appraisal or other emotional processes) can be
easily compared via modular substitution of code followed by model comparison.
To jumpstart adoption, we illustrate our points with executable code that
researchers can easily modify for their own models. We end with a discussion of
applications and future directions of the probabilistic programming approach.",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]
Hash functions from superspecial genus-2 curves using Richelot isogenies,"Wouter Castryck (KU Leuven), Thomas Decru (KU Leuven), Benjamin Smith (GRACE)","Last year Takashima proposed a version of Charles, Goren and Lauter's hash
function using Richelot isogenies, starting from a genus-2 curve that allows
for all subsequent arithmetic to be performed over a quadratic finite field
Fp2. In a very recent paper Flynn and Ti point out that Takashima's hash
function is insecure due to the existence of small isogeny cycles. We revisit
the construction and show that it can be repaired by imposing a simple
restriction, which moreover clarifies the security analysis. The runtime of the
resulting hash function is dominated by the extraction of 3 square roots for
every block of 3 bits of the message, as compared to one square root per bit in
the elliptic curve case; however in our setting the extractions can be
parallelized and are done in a finite field whose bit size is reduced by a
factor 3. Along the way we argue that the full supersingular isogeny graph is
the wrong context in which to study higher-dimensional analogues of Charles,
Goren and Lauter's hash function, and advocate the use of the superspecial
subgraph, which is the natural framework in which to view Takashima's
Fp2-friendly starting curve.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),; Number Theory (math.NT),[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

A Context-Aware Citation Recommendation Model with BERT and Graph Convolutional Networks,"Chanwoo Jeong, Sion Jang, Hyuna Shin, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Choi","With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being
published, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a
time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the
appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective,
context-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two
decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context
sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target
paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of
well-organized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high

document encoder and a context encoder, which uses Graph Convolutional Networks

A Ground-Truth Data Set and a Classification Algorithm for Eye Movements in 360-degree Videos,"Ioannis Agtzidis, Mikhail Startsev, Michael Dorr","The segmentation of a gaze trace into its constituent eye movements has been
actively researched since the early days of eye tracking. As we move towards
more naturalistic viewing conditions, the segmentation becomes even more
challenging and convoluted as more complex patterns emerge. The definitions and
the well-established methods that were developed for monitor-based eye tracking
experiments are often not directly applicable to unrestrained set-ups such as
eye tracking in wearable contexts or with head-mounted displays. The main
contributions of this work to the eye movement research for 360-degree content
are threefold: First, we collect, partially annotate, and make publicly
available a new eye tracking data set, which consists of 13 participants
viewing 15 video clips that are recorded in 360-degree. Second, we propose a
new two-stage pipeline for ground truth annotation of the traditional
fixations, saccades, smooth pursuits, as well as (optokinetic) nystagmus,
vestibulo-ocular reflex, and pursuit of moving objects performed exclusively
via the movement of the head. A flexible user interface for this pipeline is
implemented and made freely accessible for use or modification. Lastly, we
develop and test a simple proof-of-concept algorithm for automatic

White Mirror: Leaking Sensitive Information from Interactive Netflix Movies using Encrypted Traffic Analysis,"Gargi Mitra, Prasanna Karthik Vairam, Patanjali SLPSK, Nitin Chandrachoodan, Kamakoti V","Privacy leaks from Netflix videos/movies is well researched. Current
state-of-the-art works have been able to obtain coarse-grained information such
as the genre and the title of videos by passive observation of encrypted

profiles of viewers.
On 28th December 2018, Netflix released the first mainstream interactive
movie called 'Black Mirror: Bandersnatch'. In this work, we use this movie as a
case-study to show for the first time that fine-grained information (i.e.,
choices made by users) can be revealed from encrypted traffic. We use the state
information exchanged between the viewer's browser and Netflix as the
side-channel. To evaluate our proposed technique, we built the first

SceneCode: Monocular Dense Semantic Reconstruction using Learned Encoded Scene Representations,"Shuaifeng Zhi, Michael Bloesch, Stefan Leutenegger, Andrew J. Davison","Systems which incrementally create 3D semantic maps from image sequences must
store and update representations of both geometry and semantic entities.
However, while there has been much work on the correct formulation for
geometrical estimation, state-of-the-art systems usually rely on simple
semantic representations which store and update independent label estimates for
each surface element (depth pixels, surfels, or voxels). Spatial correlation is
discarded, and fused label maps are incoherent and noisy.
We introduce a new compact and optimisable semantic representation by
training a variational auto-encoder that is conditioned on a colour image.
Using this learned latent space, we can tackle semantic label fusion by jointly
optimising the low-dimenional codes associated with each of a set of
overlapping images, producing consistent fused label maps which preserve
spatial correlation. We also show how this approach can be used within a
monocular keyframe based semantic mapping system where a similar code approach
is used for geometry. The probabilistic formulation allows a flexible
formulation where we can jointly estimate motion, geometry and semantics in a

Neuromorphic Hardware learns to learn,"Thomas Bohnstingl, Franz Scherr, Christian Pehle, Karlheinz Meier, Wolfgang Maass","Hyperparameters and learning algorithms for neuromorphic hardware are usually
chosen by hand. In contrast, the hyperparameters and learning algorithms of
networks of neurons in the brain, which they aim to emulate, have been
optimized through extensive evolutionary and developmental processes for
specific ranges of computing and learning tasks. Occasionally this process has
been emulated through genetic algorithms, but these require themselves
hand-design of their details and tend to provide a limited range of
improvements. We employ instead other powerful gradient-free optimization
tools, such as cross-entropy methods and evolutionary strategies, in order to
port the function of biological optimization processes to neuromorphic
hardware. As an example, we show that this method produces neuromorphic agents
that learn very efficiently from rewards. In particular, meta-plasticity, i.e.,
the optimization of the learning rule which they use, substantially enhances
reward-based learning capability of the hardware. In addition, we demonstrate
for the first time Learning-to-Learn benefits from such hardware, in
particular, the capability to extract abstract knowledge from prior learning

Content Differences in Syntactic and Semantic Representations,"Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, Ari Rappoport","Syntactic analysis plays an important role in semantic parsing, but the
nature of this role remains a topic of ongoing debate. The debate has been
constrained by the scarcity of empirical comparative studies between syntactic
and semantic schemes, which hinders the development of parsing methods informed
by the details of target schemes and constructions. We target this gap, and
take Universal Dependencies (UD) and UCCA as a test case. After abstracting
away from differences of convention or formalism, we find that most content
divergences can be ascribed to: (1) UCCA's distinction between a Scene and a
non-Scene; (2) UCCA's distinction between primary relations, secondary ones and
participants; (3) different treatment of multi-word expressions, and (4)
different treatment of inter-clause linkage. We further discuss the long tail
of cases where the two schemes take markedly different approaches. Finally, we
show that the proposed comparison methodology can be used for fine-grained
evaluation of UCCA parsing, highlighting both challenges and potential sources
for improvement. The substantial differences between the schemes suggest that
semantic parsers are likely to benefit downstream text understanding

Integrating NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) with RISC-V SoC on FireSim,"Farzad Farshchi, Qijing Huang, Heechul Yun","NVDLA is an open-source deep neural network (DNN) accelerator which has
received a lot of attention by the community since its introduction by Nvidia.
It is a full-featured hardware IP and can serve as a good reference for
conducting research and development of SoCs with integrated accelerators.
However, an expensive FPGA board is required to do experiments with this IP in
a real SoC. Moreover, since NVDLA is clocked at a lower frequency on an FPGA,
it would be hard to do accurate performance analysis with such a setup. To
overcome these limitations, we integrate NVDLA into a real RISC-V SoC on the
Amazon cloud FPGA using FireSim, a cycle-exact FPGA-accelerated simulator. We
then evaluate the performance of NVDLA by running YOLOv3 object-detection
algorithm. Our results show that NVDLA can sustain 7.5 fps when running YOLOv3.
We further analyze the performance by showing that sharing the last-level cache
with NVDLA can result in up to 1.56x speedup. We then identify that sharing the
memory system with the accelerator can result in unpredictable execution time
for the real-time tasks running on this platform. We believe this is an
important issue that must be addressed in order for on-chip DNN accelerators to

Mutual Coinduction,Moez A. AbdelGawad,"In this paper we present mutual coinduction as a dual of mutual induction and

precise formal definition of mutual induction and mutual coinduction. In the
process we present the associated mutual induction and mutual coinduction proof
principles, and we present the conditions under which these principles hold.
In spite of some mention of mutual (co)induction in research literature, but
the formal definition of mutual (co)induction and the proof of the mutual
(co)induction proof principles we present here seem to be the first such
definition and proof. As such, it seems our work is the first to point out that
monotonicity of mutual generators seems not sufficient for guaranteeing the
existence of least and greatest simultaneous fixed points in complete lattices,

existence. [The paper has been responsively updated so as to not require the
continuity of generators but only require their monotonicity, and it now

paper to reflect the relaxed requirement is currently underway.]

number of transmitters and receivers, where each transmitter is connected to
two subsequent receivers. Each transmitter has individual access to a backhaul
link (fetching the equivalent of $M_{T}$ files), while each receiver can cache
a fraction $\gamma$ of the library. We explore the tradeoff between the
communication rate, backhaul load, and caching storage by designing algorithms
that can harness the benefits of cooperative transmission in partially
connected networks, while exploiting the advantages of multicast transmissions
attributed to user caching. We show that receiver caching and fetching content
from the backhaul are two resources that can simultaneously increase the
delivery performance in synergistic ways.
Specifically, an interesting outcome of this work is that user caching of a
fraction $\gamma$ of the library can increase the per-user Degrees of Freedom
(puDoF) by $\gamma$. Further, the results reveal significant savings in the
backhaul load, even in the small cache size region. For example, the puDoF
achieved using the pair $(M_{T}=8,

remarkable performance in a variety of applications. As we try to solve more

interest as the third-generation of neural networks due to their event-driven

their complex dynamics of neurons and non-differentiable spike operations.
Furthermore, their applications have been limited to relatively simple tasks

degradation of SNNs in a more challenging regression problem (i.e., object

channel-wise normalization and signed neuron with imbalanced threshold, both of

while events indicate changes between the latent images. Thus, we are able to
model the blur-generation process by associating event data to a latent sharp
image. Based on the abundant event data alongside low frame rate, easily
blurred images, we propose a simple yet effective approach to reconstruct
high-quality and high frame rate sharp videos. Starting with a single blurred
frame and its event data, we propose the Event-based Double Integral (EDI)
model and solve it by adding regularization terms. Then, we extend it to
multiple Event-based Double Integral (mEDI) model to get more smooth results
based on multiple images and their events. Furthermore, we provide a new and
more efficient solver to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the
energy function, we achieve significant improvements in removing blur and the
reconstruction of a high temporal resolution video. The video generation is
based on solving a simple non-convex optimization problem in a single scalar
variable. Experimental results on both synthetic and real sequences demonstrate
the superiority of our mEDI model and optimization method compared to the state
of the art.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,"[Submitted on 12 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 23 Apr 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Multi-Representational Learning for Offline Signature Verification using Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble of CNNs,"Saeed Masoudnia, Omid Mersa, Babak N. Araabi, Abdol-Hossein Vahabie, Mohammad Amin Sadeghi, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi","Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a challenging pattern recognition
task, especially in presence of skilled forgeries that are not available during
training. This study aims to tackle its challenges and meet the substantial
need for generalization for OSV by examining different loss functions for
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We adopt our new approach to OSV by asking
two questions: 1. which classification loss provides more generalization for
feature learning in OSV? , and 2. How integration of different losses into a
unified multi-loss function lead to an improved learning framework? These
questions are studied based on analysis of three loss functions, including
cross entropy, Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, and hinge loss. According to
complementary features of these losses, we combine them into a dynamic
multi-loss function and propose a novel ensemble framework for simultaneous use
of them in CNN. Our proposed Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble (MLSE) consists of
several sequential trials. In each trial, a dominant loss function is selected
from the multi-loss set, and the remaining losses act as a regularizer.
Different trials learn diverse representations for each input based on
signature identification task. This multi-representation set is then employed
for the verification task. An ensemble of SVMs is trained on these
representations, and their decisions are finally combined according to the
selection of most generalizable SVM for each user. We conducted two sets of
experiments based on two different protocols of OSV, i.e., writer-dependent and
writer-independent on three signature datasets: GPDS-Synthetic, MCYT, and
UT-SIG. Based on the writer-dependent OSV protocol, we achieved substantial
improvements over the best EERs in the literature. The results of the second
set of experiments also confirmed the robustness to the arrival of new users
enrolled in the OSV system.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 11 Mar 2019]
Alignment Based Matching Networks for One-Shot Classification and Open-Set Recognition,"Paresh Malalur, Tommi Jaakkola","Deep learning for object classification relies heavily on convolutional
models. While effective, CNNs are rarely interpretable after the fact. An
attention mechanism can be used to highlight the area of the image that the
model focuses on thus offering a narrow view into the mechanism of
classification. We expand on this idea by forcing the method to explicitly
align images to be classified to reference images representing the classes. The
mechanism of alignment is learned and therefore does not require that the
reference objects are anything like those being classified. Beyond explanation,
our exemplar based cross-alignment method enables classification with only a
single example per category (one-shot). Our model cuts the 5-way, 1-shot error
rate in Omniglot from 2.1% to 1.4% and in MiniImageNet from 53.5% to 46.5%
while simultaneously providing point-wise alignment information providing some
understanding on what the network is capturing. This method of alignment also
enables the recognition of an unsupported class (open-set) in the one-shot
setting while maintaining an F1-score of above 0.5 for Omniglot even with 19
other distracting classes while baselines completely fail to separate the
open-set class in the one-shot setting.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 11 Mar 2019]
Age prediction using a large chest X-ray dataset,"Alexandros Karargyris, Satyananda Kashyap, Joy T Wu, Arjun Sharma, Mehdi Moradi, Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood","Age prediction based on appearances of different anatomies in medical images
has been clinically explored for many decades. In this paper, we used deep
learning to predict a persons age on Chest X-Rays. Specifically, we trained a
CNN in regression fashion on a large publicly available dataset. Moreover, for
interpretability, we explored activation maps to identify which areas of a CXR
image are important for the machine (i.e. CNN) to predict a patients age,
offering insight. Overall, amongst correctly predicted CXRs, we see areas near
the clavicles, shoulders, spine, and mediastinum being most activated for age
prediction, as one would expect biologically. Amongst incorrectly predicted
CXRs, we have qualitatively identified disease patterns that could possibly
make the anatomies appear older or younger than expected. A further technical
and clinical evaluation would improve this work. As CXR is the most commonly
requested imaging exam, a potential use case for estimating age may be found in
the preventative counseling of patient health status compared to their
age-expected average, particularly when there is a large discrepancy between
predicted age and the real patient age.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 9 Mar 2019]
Superpixel Contracted Graph-Based Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification,"Philip Sellars, Angelica Aviles-Rivero, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb","A central problem in hyperspectral image classification is obtaining high
classification accuracy when using a limited amount of labelled data. In this
paper we present a novel graph-based framework, which aims to tackle this
problem in the presence of large scale data input. Our approach utilises a
novel superpixel method, specifically designed for hyperspectral data, to
define meaningful local regions in an image, which with high probability share
the same classification label. We then extract spectral and spatial features
from these regions and use these to produce a contracted weighted
graph-representation, where each node represents a region rather than a pixel.
Our graph is then fed into a graph-based semi-supervised classifier which gives
the final classification. We show that using superpixels in a graph
representation is an effective tool for speeding up graphical classifiers
applied to hyperspectral images. We demonstrate through exhaustive quantitative
and qualitative results that our proposed method produces accurate
classifications when an incredibly small amount of labelled data is used. We
show that our approach mitigates the major drawbacks of existing approaches,

Constrained Mutual Convex Cone Method for Image Set Based Recognition,"Naoya Sogi, Rui Zhu, Jing-Hao Xue, Kazuhiro Fukui","In this paper, we propose a method for image-set classification based on
convex cone models. Image set classification aims to classify a set of images,
which were usually obtained from video frames or multi-view cameras, into a
target object. To accurately and stably classify a set, it is essential to
represent structural information of the set accurately. There are various
representative image features, such as histogram based features, HLAC, and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. We should note that most of them
have non-negativity and thus can be effectively represented by a convex cone.
This leads us to introduce the convex cone representation to image-set
classification. To establish a convex cone based framework, we mathematically
define multiple angles between two convex cones, and then define the geometric
similarity between the cones using the angles. Moreover, to enhance the
framework, we introduce a discriminant space that maximizes the between-class
variance (gaps) and minimizes the within-class variance of the projected convex
cones onto the discriminant space, similar to the Fisher discriminant analysis.
Finally, the classification is performed based on the similarity between
projected convex cones. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated experimentally by using five databases: CMU PIE dataset, ETH-80,
CMU Motion of Body dataset, Youtube Celebrity dataset, and a private database
of multi-view hand shapes.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG),[Submitted on 14 Mar 2019]
Replication-Aware Linearizability,"Constantin Enea, Suha Orhun Mutluergil, Gustavo Petri, Chao Wang","Geo-distributed systems often replicate data at multiple locations to achieve
availability and performance despite network partitions. These systems must
accept updates at any replica and propagate these updates asynchronously to
every other replica. Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) provide a
principled approach to the problem of ensuring that replicas are eventually
consistent despite the asynchronous delivery of updates.
We address the problem of specifying and verifying CRDTs, introducing a new
correctness criterion called Replication-Aware Linearizability. This criterion
is inspired by linearizability, the de-facto correctness criterion for
(shared-memory) concurrent data structures. We argue that this criterion is
both simple to understand, and it fits most known implementations of CRDTs. We
provide a proof methodology to show that a CRDT satisfies replication-aware
linearizability which we apply on a wide range of implementations. Finally, we
show that our criterion can be leveraged to reason modularly about the
composition of CRDTs.",Programming Languages (cs.PL),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

Role of Bloom Filter in Big Data Research: A Survey,"Ripon Patgiri, Sabuzima Nayak, Samir Kumar Borgohain","Big Data is the most popular emerging trends that becomes a blessing for

Inserting Videos into Videos,"Donghoon Lee, Tomas Pfister, Ming-Hsuan Yang","In this paper, we introduce a new problem of manipulating a given video by
inserting other videos into it. Our main task is, given an object video and a
scene video, to insert the object video at a user-specified location in the
scene video so that the resulting video looks realistic. We aim to handle
different object motions and complex backgrounds without expensive segmentation
annotations. As it is difficult to collect training pairs for this problem, we
synthesize fake training pairs that can provide helpful supervisory signals
when training a neural network with unpaired real data. The proposed network
architecture can take both real and fake pairs as input and perform both
supervised and unsupervised training in an adversarial learning scheme. To
synthesize a realistic video, the network renders each frame based on the
current input and previous frames. Within this framework, we observe that
injecting noise into previous frames while generating the current frame
stabilizes training. We conduct experiments on real-world videos in object
tracking and person re-identification benchmark datasets. Experimental results

NP-hard on bipartite graphs. We also show that deciding if a PDS is

Selective Kernel Networks,"Xiang Li, Wenhai Wang, Xiaolin Hu, Jian Yang","In standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive fields of
artificial neurons in each layer are designed to share the same size. It is
well-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of
visual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely

CNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size
based on multiple scales of input information. A building block called
Selective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with
different kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the
information in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield
different sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion
layer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel
Networks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show
that SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower
model complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture
target objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons
for adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.

Distribution-Sensitive Bounds on Relative Approximations of Geometric Ranges,"Yufei Tao, Yu Wang","A family $\mathcal{R}$ of ranges and a set $X$ of points together define a
range space $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, where $\mathcal{R}|_X = \{X \cap h \mid h
\in \mathcal{R}\}$. We want to find a structure to estimate the quantity $|X
\cap h|/|X|$ for any range $h \in \mathcal{R}$ with the $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-guarantee: (i) if $|X \cap h|/|X| > \rho$, the estimate must have a
relative error $\epsilon$; (ii) otherwise, the estimate must have an absolute
error $\rho \epsilon$. The objective is to minimize the size of the structure.
Currently, the dominant solution is to compute a relative $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-approximation, which is a subset of $X$ with
$\tilde{O}(\lambda/(\rho \epsilon^2))$ points, where $\lambda$ is the
VC-dimension of $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylog factors.
This paper shows a more general bound sensitive to the content of $X$. We
give a structure that stores $O(\log (1/\rho))$ integers plus $\tilde{O}(\theta
\cdot (\lambda/\epsilon^2))$ points of $X$, where $\theta$ - called the
disagreement coefficient - measures how much the ranges differ from each other
in their intersections with $X$. The value of $\theta$ is between 1 and
$1/\rho$, such that our space bound is never worse than that of relative
$(\rho, \epsilon)$-approximations, but we improve the latter's $1/\rho$ term
whenever $\theta = o(\frac{1}{\rho \log (1/\rho)})$. We also prove that, in the
worst case, summaries with the $(\rho, 1/2)$-guarantee must consume
$\Omega(\theta)$ words even for $d = 2$ and $\lambda \le 3$.
We then constrain $\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$
for a constant $d$, and prove the existence of structures with $o(1/(\rho
\epsilon^2))$ size offering $(\rho,\epsilon)$-guarantees, when $X$ is generated
from various stochastic distributions. This is the first formal justification
on why the term $1/\rho$ is not compulsory for ""realistic"" inputs.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to-Sequence Models,"Paul Michel, Xian Li, Graham Neubig, Juan Miguel Pino","Adversarial examples --- perturbations to the input of a model that elicit
large changes in the output --- have been shown to be an effective way of
assessing the robustness of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. However,
these perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change
the input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the
expected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the
growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on
machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial
attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and
post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that
existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the
aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in
changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate
that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial
perturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change
the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial
training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of
adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance. A toolkit

affect the model accuracy. They are achieved by exploiting the iterative nature
of the training algorithm of deep learning to derive the lifetime and
read/write order of all variables. With the lifetime semantics, we are able to
implement a memory pool with minimal fragments. However, the optimization
problem is NP-complete. We propose a heuristic algorithm that reduces up to
13.3% of memory compared with Nvidia's default memory pool with equal time
complexity. With the read/write semantics, the variables that are not in use
can be swapped out from GPU to CPU to reduce the memory footprint. We propose
multiple swapping strategies to automatically decide which variable to swap and
when to swap out (in), which reduces the memory cost by up to 34.2% without
communication overhead.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 19 Feb 2019]
TrojDRL: Trojan Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents,"Panagiota Kiourti, Kacper Wardega, Susmit Jha, Wenchao Li","Recent work has identified that classification models implemented as neural
networks are vulnerable to data-poisoning and Trojan attacks at training time.
In this work, we show that these training-time vulnerabilities extend to deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) agents and can be exploited by an adversary with
access to the training process. In particular, we focus on Trojan attacks that
augment the function of reinforcement learning policies with hidden behaviors.
We demonstrate that such attacks can be implemented through minuscule data
poisoning (as little as 0.025% of the training data) and in-band reward
modification that does not affect the reward on normal inputs. The policies
learned with our proposed attack approach perform imperceptibly similar to
benign policies but deteriorate drastically when the Trojan is triggered in
both targeted and untargeted settings. Furthermore, we show that existing
Trojan defense mechanisms for classification tasks are not effective in the
reinforcement learning setting.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 1 Mar 2019]
Analyzing digital politics: Challenges and experiments in a dual perspective,"Géraldine Castel (ILCEA4), Genoveva Vargas-Solar (ILCEA4), Javier Espinosa-Oviedo (TU Delft)","Social networks have become in the last decade central to political life.
However, to those interested in analysing the communication strategies of

GestureKeeper: Gesture Recognition for Controlling Devices in IoT Environments,"Vasileios Sideridis, Andrew Zacharakis, George Tzagkarakis, Maria Papadopouli","This paper introduces and evaluates the GestureKeeper, a robust hand-gesture
recognition system based on a wearable inertial measurements unit (IMU). The
identification of the time windows where the gestures occur, without relying on
an explicit user action or a special gesture marker, is a very challenging
task. To address this problem, GestureKeeper identifies the start of a gesture
by exploiting the underlying dynamics of the associated time series using a
recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA is a powerful method for
nonlinear time-series analysis, which enables the detection of critical
transitions in the system's dynamical behavior. Most importantly, it does not
make any assumption about the underlying distribution or model that governs the
data. Having estimated the gesture window, a support vector machine is employed
to recognize the specific gesture. Our proposed method is evaluated by means of
a small-scale pilot study at FORTH and demonstrated that GestureKeeper can
identify correctly the start of a gesture with a 87\% mean balanced accuracy
and classify correctly the specific hand-gesture with a mean accuracy of over
96\%. To the best of our knowledge, GestureKeeper is the first automatic
hand-gesture identification system based only on accelerometer. The performance
analysis reveals the predictive power of the features and the system's
robustness in the presence of additive noise. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis to examine the impact of various parameters and a comparative analysis
of different classifiers (SVM, random forests). Most importantly, the system
can be extended to incorporate a large dictionary of gestures and operate
without further calibration for a new user.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

On Energy Efficiency and Performance Evaluation of SBC based Clusters: A Hadoop case study,"Basit Qureshi, Anis Koubaa","Energy efficiency in a data center is a challenge and has garnered
researchers interest. In this paper we address the energy efficiency issue of a
small scale data center by utilizing Single Board Computer (SBC) based

these clusters using popular performance benchmarks for task execution time,
memory/storage utilization, network throughput and energy consumption. Further,
we investigate the cost of operating SBC based clusters by correlating energy
utilization for the execution time of various benchmarks using workloads of
different sizes. Results show that, although the low-cost benefit of a cluster
built with ARM-based SBCs is desirable, these clusters yield low comparable
performance and energy efficiency due to limited onboard capabilities. It is

Effects of Self-Avatar and Gaze on Avoidance Movement Behavior,"Christos Mousas, Alexandros Koilias, Dimitris Anastasiou, Banafsheh Rekabdar, Christos-Nikolaos Anagnostopoulos","The present study investigates users' movement behavior in a virtual
environment when they attempted to avoid a virtual character. At each iteration

Self-Avatar No LookAt, and No Self-Avatar No LookAt) were applied to examine
users' movement behavior based on kinematic measures. During the experiment, 52
participants were asked to walk from a starting position to a target position.
A virtual character was placed at the midpoint. Participants were asked to wear
a head-mounted display throughout the task, and their locomotion was captured
using a motion capture suit. We analyzed the captured trajectories of the
participants' routes on four kinematic measures to explore whether the four
experimental conditions influenced the paths they took. The results indicated
that the Self-Avatar LookAt condition affected the path the participants chose
more significantly than the other three conditions in terms of length,
duration, and deviation, but not in terms of speed. Overall, the length and
duration of the task, as well as the deviation of the trajectory from the

Surface Compression Using Dynamic Color Palettes,"Ayub A. Gubran, Felix Huang, Tor M. Aamodt","Off-chip memory traffic is a major source of power and energy consumption on
mobile platforms. A large amount of this off-chip traffic is used to manipulate
graphics framebuffer surfaces. To cut down the cost of accessing off-chip
memory, framebuffer surfaces are compressed to reduce the bandwidth consumed on
surface manipulation when rendering or displaying.
In this work, we study the compression properties of framebuffer surfaces and
highlight the fact that surfaces from different applications have different
compression characteristics. We use the results of our analysis to propose a
scheme, Dynamic Color Palettes (DCP), which achieves higher compression rates
with UI and 2D surfaces.
DCP is a hardware mechanism for exploiting inter-frame coherence in lossless
surface compression; it implements a scheme that dynamically constructs color
palettes, which are then used to efficiently compress framebuffer surfaces. To
evaluate DCP, we created an extensive set of OpenGL workload traces from 124

Adaptive Probabilistic Tack Manoeuvre Decision for Sailing Vessels,"Sébastien Lemaire, Yu Cao, Thomas Kluyver, Daniel Hausner, Camil Vasilovici, Zhong-yuen Lee, Umberto José Varbaro, Sophia M. Schillai","To move upwind, sailing vessels have to cross the wind by tacking. During

tack implementations.
This paper develops an adaptive probabilistic tack manoeuvre decision method.
The order of attempting different tacking strategies is based on previous
success within a timeout, combined with an exploration component. This method

strategies for crossing the wind were evaluated through adaptive probabilistic

Improving Strong-Scaling of CNN Training by Exploiting Finer-Grained Parallelism,"Nikoli Dryden, Naoya Maruyama, Tom Benson, Tim Moon, Marc Snir, Brian Van Essen","Scaling CNN training is necessary to keep up with growing datasets and reduce
training time. We also see an emerging need to handle datasets with very large
samples, where memory requirements for training are large. Existing training
frameworks use a data-parallel approach that partitions samples within a
mini-batch, but limits to scaling the mini-batch size and memory consumption
makes this untenable for large samples. We describe and implement new
approaches to convolution, which parallelize using spatial decomposition or a
combination of sample and spatial decomposition. This introduces many
performance knobs for a network, so we develop a performance model for CNNs and
present a method for using it to automatically determine efficient
parallelization strategies.
We evaluate our algorithms with microbenchmarks and image classification with
ResNet-50. Our algorithms allow us to prototype a model for a mesh-tangling

kPAM: KeyPoint Affordances for Category-Level Robotic Manipulation,"Lucas Manuelli, Wei Gao, Peter Florence, Russ Tedrake","We would like robots to achieve purposeful manipulation by placing any
instance from a category of objects into a desired set of goal states. Existing
manipulation pipelines typically specify the desired configuration as a target
6-DOF pose and rely on explicitly estimating the pose of the manipulated
objects. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation
defined on a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape
variation, and specifying a target pose at a category level can be physically
infeasible or fail to accomplish the task -- e.g. knowing the pose and size of
a coffee mug relative to some canonical mug is not sufficient to successfully
hang it on a rack by its handle. Hence we propose a novel formulation of
category-level manipulation that uses semantic 3D keypoints as the object
representation. This keypoint representation enables a simple and interpretable
specification of the manipulation target as geometric costs and constraints on
the keypoints, which flexibly generalizes existing pose-based manipulation
methods. Using this formulation, we factor the manipulation policy into
instance segmentation, 3D keypoint detection, optimization-based robot action
planning and local dense-geometry-based action execution. This factorization
allows us to leverage advances in these sub-problems and combine them into a
general and effective perception-to-action manipulation pipeline. Our pipeline
is robust to large intra-category shape variation and topology changes as the
keypoint representation ignores task-irrelevant geometric details. Extensive
hardware experiments demonstrate our method can reliably accomplish tasks with
never-before seen objects in a category, such as placing shoes and mugs with
significant shape variation into category level target configurations.",Robotics (cs.RO),,"[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 29 Oct 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Augmenting Visual SLAM with Wi-Fi Sensing For Indoor Applications,"Zakieh S. Hashemifar, Charuvahan Adhivarahan, Anand Balakrishnan, Karthik Dantu","Recent trends have accelerated the development of spatial applications on
mobile devices and robots. These include navigation, augmented reality,
human-robot interaction, and others. A key enabling technology for such
applications is the understanding of the device's location and the map of the
surrounding environment. This generic problem, referred to as Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM), is an extensively researched topic in
robotics. However, visual SLAM algorithms face several challenges including
perceptual aliasing and high computational cost. These challenges affect the
accuracy, efficiency, and viability of visual SLAM algorithms, especially for
long-term SLAM, and their use in resource-constrained mobile devices.
A parallel trend is the ubiquity of Wi-Fi routers for quick Internet access
in most urban environments. Most robots and mobile devices are equipped with a
Wi-Fi radio as well. We propose a method to utilize Wi-Fi received signal
strength to alleviate the challenges faced by visual SLAM algorithms. To
demonstrate the utility of this idea, this work makes the following

visual SLAM algorithms, (ii) We integrate such sensing into three well-known
SLAM algorithms, (iii) Using four distinct datasets, we demonstrate the
performance of such augmentation in comparison to the original visual
algorithms and (iv) We compare our work to Wi-Fi augmented FABMAP algorithm.

Module-per-Object: a Human-Driven Methodology for C++-based High-Level Synthesis Design,"Jeferson Santiago da Silva, François-Raymond Boyer, J.M. Pierre Langlois","High-Level Synthesis (HLS) brings FPGAs to audiences previously unfamiliar to
hardware design. However, achieving the highest Quality-of-Results (QoR) with
HLS is still unattainable for most programmers. This requires detailed
knowledge of FPGA architecture and hardware design in order to produce
FPGA-friendly codes. Moreover, these codes are normally in conflict with best
coding practices, which favor code reuse, modularity, and conciseness.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-per-Object (MpO), a
human-driven HLS design methodology intended for both hardware designers and
software developers with limited FPGA expertise. MpO exploits modern C++ to
raise the abstraction level while improving QoR, code readability and
modularity. To guide HLS designers, we present the five characteristics of MpO
classes. Each characteristic exploits the power of HLS-supported modern C++
features to build C++-based hardware modules. These characteristics lead to
high-quality software descriptions and efficient hardware generation. We also
present a use case of MpO, where we use C++ as the intermediate language for
FPGA-targeted code generation from P4, a packet processing domain specific
language. The MpO methodology is evaluated using three design experiments: a
packet parser, a flow-based traffic manager, and a digital up-converter. Based
on experiments, we show that MpO can be comparable to hand-written VHDL code
while keeping a high abstraction level, human-readable coding style and
modularity. Compared to traditional C-based HLS design, MpO leads to more
efficient circuit generation, both in terms of performance and resource
utilization. Also, the MpO approach notably improves software quality,
augmenting parametrization while eliminating the incidence of code duplication.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,"[Submitted on 5 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 9 Apr 2019 (this version, v2)]"

Bulow-Klemperer-Style Results for Welfare Maximization in Two-Sided Markets,"Moshe Babaioff, Kira Goldner, Yannai A. Gonczarowski","We consider the problem of welfare maximization in two-sided markets using
simple mechanisms that are prior-independent. The Myerson-Satterthwaite
impossibility theorem shows that even for bilateral trade, there is no feasible
(IR, truthful, budget balanced) mechanism that has welfare as high as the
optimal-yet-infeasible VCG mechanism, which attains maximal welfare but runs a
deficit. On the other hand, the optimal feasible mechanism needs to be
carefully tailored to the Bayesian prior, and is extremely complex, eluding a
precise description.
We present Bulow-Klemperer-style results to circumvent these hurdles in
double-auction markets. We suggest using the Buyer Trade Reduction (BTR)
mechanism, a variant of McAfee's mechanism, which is feasible and simple (in
particular, deterministic, truthful, prior-independent, anonymous). First, in
the setting where buyers' and sellers' values are sampled i.i.d. from the same
distribution, we show that for any such market of any size, BTR with one
additional buyer whose value is sampled from the same distribution has expected
welfare at least as high as the optimal in the original market.
We then move to a more general setting where buyers' values are sampled from
one distribution and sellers' from another, focusing on the case where the
buyers' distribution first-order stochastically dominates the sellers'. We
present bounds on the number of buyers that, when added, guarantees that BTR in
the augmented market have welfare at least as high as the optimal in the
original market. Our lower bounds extend to a large class of mechanisms, and
all of our results extend to adding sellers instead of buyers. In addition, we
present positive results about the usefulness of pricing at a sample for
welfare maximization in two-sided markets under the above two settings, which

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage early warning system prototype

visualization. In the first stage, a computationally efficient anomaly
detection method based on quartiles detects the presence of a fault in real
time. In the second stage, the fault is classified into one of nine pre-defined

discriminative features by applying dimensionality reduction based on temporal
autocorrelation. The features are then mapped through one of three
classification techniques: support vector machine, random forest, and
artificial neural network. Finally in the third stage, intra-class clustering
based on dynamic time warping is used to characterize the fault with further
granularity. Results on the Bonneville Power Administration electric grid data
show that i) the proposed anomaly detector is both fast and accurate; ii)
dimensionality reduction leads to dramatic improvement in classification
accuracy and speed; iii) the random forest method offers the most accurate,

Live Reconstruction of Large-Scale Dynamic Outdoor Worlds,"Ondrej Miksik, Vibhav Vineet","Standard 3D reconstruction pipelines assume stationary world, therefore

We propose an end-to-end system for live reconstruction of large-scale

efficient data-driven approaches for 6-DoF object pose estimation to segment
the scene into objects and stationary `background'. This allows us to represent
the scene using a time-dependent (dynamic) map, in which each object is
explicitly represented as a separate instance and reconstructed in its own
volume. For each time step, our dynamic map maintains a relative pose of each
volume with respect to the stationary background. Our system operates in
incremental manner which is essential for on-line reconstruction, handles
large-scale environments with objects at large distances and runs in (near)

Predicting Academic Performance for College Students: A Campus Behavior Perspective,"Huaxiu Yao, Defu Lian, Yi Cao, Yifan Wu, Tao Zhou","Detecting abnormal behaviors of students in time and providing personalized
intervention and guidance at the early stage is important in educational
management. Academic performance prediction is an important building block to
enabling this pre-intervention and guidance. Most of the previous studies are
based on questionnaire surveys and self-reports, which suffer from small sample
size and social desirability bias. In this paper, we collect longitudinal
behavioral data from 6,597 students' smart cards and propose three major types
of discriminative behavioral factors, diligence, orderliness, and sleep
patterns. Empirical analysis demonstrates these behavioral factors are strongly
correlated with academic performance. Furthermore, motivated by social
influence theory, we analyze the correlation between each student's academic
performance with his/her behaviorally similar students'. Statistical tests
indicate this correlation is significant. Based on these factors, we further
build a multi-task predictive framework based on a learning-to-rank algorithm
for academic performance prediction. This framework captures inter-semester
correlation, inter-major correlation and integrates student similarity to
predict students' academic performance. The experiments on a large-scale
real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our methods for predicting
academic performance and the effectiveness of proposed behavioral factors.",Computers and Society (cs.CY),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]
On Sample Complexity of Projection-Free Primal-Dual Methods for Learning Mixture Policies in Markov Decision Processes,"Masoud Badiei Khuzani, Varun Vasudevan, Hongyi Ren, Lei Xing","We study the problem of learning policy of an infinite-horizon, discounted
cost, Markov decision process (MDP) with a large number of states. We compute
the actions of a policy that is nearly as good as a policy chosen by a suitable
oracle from a given mixture policy class characterized by the convex hull of a
set of known base policies. To learn the coefficients of the mixture model, we
recast the problem as an approximate linear programming (ALP) formulation for
MDPs, where the feature vectors correspond to the occupation measures of the
base policies defined on the state-action space. We then propose a
projection-free stochastic primal-dual method with the Bregman divergence to
solve the characterized ALP. Furthermore, we analyze the probably approximately
correct (PAC) sample complexity of the proposed stochastic algorithm, namely
the number of queries required to achieve near optimal objective value. We also
propose a modification of our proposed algorithm with the polytope constraint
sampling for the smoothed ALP, where the restriction to lower bounding
approximations are relaxed. In addition, we apply the proposed algorithms to a
queuing problem, and compare their performance with a penalty function
algorithm. The numerical results illustrates that the primal-dual achieves
better efficiency and low variance across different trials compared to the

A Data Mining Approach to Flight Arrival Delay Prediction for American Airlines,Navoneel Chakrabarty,"In the present scenario of domestic flights in USA, there have been numerous
instances of flight delays and cancellations. In the United States, the
American Airlines, Inc. have been one of the most entrusted and the world's

domestic flights, AA has not lived up to the expectations in terms of
punctuality or on-time performance. Flight Delays also result in airline
companies operating commercial flights to incur huge losses. So, they are

certain measures. This study aims at analyzing flight information of US
domestic flights operated by American Airlines, covering top 5 busiest airports

Analysis of a Stochastic Model for Coordinated Platooning of Heavy-duty Vehicles,"Xi Xiong, Erdong Xiao, Li Jin","Platooning of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) is a key component of smart and
connected highways and is expected to bring remarkable fuel savings and
emission reduction. In this paper, we study the coordination of HDV platooning

Multiple HDVs are merged into one platoon if their headways are below a given
threshold. The merging is done by accelerating the following vehicles to catch
up with the leading ones. We characterize the following random variables: (i)
platoon size, (ii) headway between platoons, and (iii) travel time increment
due to platoon formation. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to
determine the headway threshold for platooning that leads to minimal cost (time
plus fuel). We also compare our results with that from Simulation of Urban

Wasserstein Distance based Deep Adversarial Transfer Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis,"Cheng Cheng, Beitong Zhou, Guijun Ma, Dongrui Wu, Ye Yuan","The demand of artificial intelligent adoption for condition-based maintenance
strategy is astonishingly increased over the past few years. Intelligent fault
diagnosis is one critical topic of maintenance solution for mechanical systems.
Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been
successfully applied to fault diagnosis tasks for mechanical systems and
achieved promising results. However, for diverse working conditions in the
industry, deep learning suffers two difficulties: one is that the well-defined
(source domain) and new (target domain) datasets are with different feature
distributions; another one is the fact that insufficient or no labelled data in
target domain significantly reduce the accuracy of fault diagnosis. As a novel
idea, deep transfer learning (DTL) is created to perform learning in the target
domain by leveraging information from the relevant source domain. Inspired by
Wasserstein distance of optimal transport, in this paper, we propose a novel
DTL approach to intelligent fault diagnosis, namely Wasserstein Distance based
Deep Transfer Learning (WD-DTL), to learn domain feature representations
(generated by a CNN based feature extractor) and to minimize the distributions
between the source and target domains through adversarial training. The
effectiveness of the proposed WD-DTL is verified through 3 transfer scenarios

Atari-HEAD: Atari Human Eye-Tracking and Demonstration Dataset,"Ruohan Zhang, Calen Walshe, Zhuode Liu, Lin Guan, Karl S. Muller, Jake A. Whritner, Luxin Zhang, Mary M. Hayhoe, Dana H. Ballard","Large-scale public datasets have been shown to benefit research in multiple
areas of modern artificial intelligence. For decision-making research that
requires human data, high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to
facilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible
standard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain
high levels of performance. Therefore, measuring eye movements can provide a
rich source of information about the strategies that humans use to solve
decision-making tasks. Here, we provide a large-scale, high-quality dataset of
human actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play
Atari video games. The dataset consists of 117 hours of gameplay data from a
diverse set of 20 games, with 8 million action demonstrations and 328 million
gaze samples. We introduce a novel form of gameplay, in which the human plays
in a semi-frame-by-frame manner. This leads to near-optimal game decisions and
game scores that are comparable or better than known human records. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset through two simple applications:
predicting human gaze and imitating human demonstrated actions. The quality of
the data leads to promising results in both tasks. Moreover, using a learned
human gaze model to inform imitation learning leads to an 115\% increase in
game performance. We interpret these results as highlighting the importance of
incorporating human visual attention in models of decision making and
demonstrating the value of the current dataset to the research community. We

Zero Shot Learning with the Isoperimetric Loss,"Shay Deutsch, Andrea Bertozzi, Stefano Soatto","We introduce the isoperimetric loss as a regularization criterion for

visual and semantic embedding spaces. However, the spaces themselves are not
linear, and we postulate the sample embedding to be populated by noisy samples
near otherwise smooth manifolds. We exploit the graph structure defined by the
sample points to regularize the estimates of the manifolds by inferring the
graph connectivity using a generalization of the isoperimetric inequalities
from Riemannian geometry to graphs. Surprisingly, this regularization alone,
paired with the simplest baseline model, outperforms the state-of-the-art among

Online Antenna Tuning in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Eren Balevi, Jeffrey G. Andrews","We aim to jointly optimize antenna tilt angle, and vertical and horizontal
half-power beamwidths of the macrocells in a heterogeneous cellular network

interference render this optimization prohibitively complex. Utilizing a single
agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for this optimization becomes quite
suboptimum despite its scalability, whereas multi-agent RL algorithms yield
better solutions at the expense of scalability. Hence, we propose a compromise
algorithm between these two. Specifically, a multi-agent mean field RL
algorithm is first utilized in the offline phase so as to transfer information
as features for the second (online) phase single agent RL algorithm, which
employs a deep neural network to learn users locations. This two-step approach
is a practical solution for real deployments, which should automatically adapt
to environmental changes in the network. Our results illustrate that the
proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the multi-agent RL, which

Fundamentals of Power Allocation Strategies for Downlink Multi-user NOMA with Target Rates,"Jose Armando Oviedo, Hamid R. Sadjadpour","For downlink multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems with
successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers, and a base-station not

between the target rates and power allocation is investigated. It is proven
that the total interference from signals not removed by SIC has a fundamental
upper-limit which is a function of the target rates, and the outage probability
is one when exceeding this limit. The concept of well-behaved power allocation
strategies is defined, and its properties are proven to be derived solely based
on the target rates. The existence of power allocation strategies that enable
NOMA to outperform OMA in per-user outage probability is proven, and are always
well-behaved for the case when the outage probability performance of NOMA and
OMA are equal for all users. The proposed SIC decoding order is then shown to
the most energy efficient. The derivation of well-behaved power allocation

Does Homophily Make Socialbots More Influential? Exploring Infiltration Strategies,"Samaneh Hosseini Moghaddam, Mandana Khademi, Maghsoud Abbaspour","Socialbots are intelligent software controlling all the behavior of fake

phase to countermeasure the malicious activities of the socialbots is studying
their characteristics and revealing strategies they can employ to successfully
infiltrate stealthily into target online social network. In this paper,we
investigate the success of using different infiltration strategies in terms of
infiltration performance and being stealthy. Every strategy is characterized by
socialbots profile and behavioral characteristics. The findings from this study
illustrate that assuming a specific taste for the tweets a socialbot retweets

Detecting GAN generated Fake Images using Co-occurrence Matrices,"Lakshmanan Nataraj, Tajuddin Manhar Mohammed, Shivkumar Chandrasekaran, Arjuna Flenner, Jawadul H. Bappy, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, B. S. Manjunath","The advent of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has brought about
completely novel ways of transforming and manipulating pixels in digital
images. GAN based techniques such as Image-to-Image translations, DeepFakes,
and other automated methods have become increasingly popular in creating fake
images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect GAN generated fake
images using a combination of co-occurrence matrices and deep learning. We
extract co-occurrence matrices on three color channels in the pixel domain and
train a model using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework.
Experimental results on two diverse and challenging GAN datasets comprising
more than 56,000 images based on unpaired image-to-image translations (cycleGAN

Visual recognition in the wild by sampling deep similarity functions,"Mikhail Usvyatsov, Konrad Schindler","Recognising relevant objects or object states in its environment is a basic
capability for an autonomous robot. The dominant approach to object recognition
in images and range images is classification by supervised machine learning,
nowadays mostly with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This works well
for target classes whose variability can be completely covered with training
examples. However, a robot moving in the wild, i.e., in an environment that is
not known at the time the recognition system is trained, will often face
\emph{domain shift}: the training data cannot be assumed to exhaustively cover
all the within-class variability that will be encountered in the test data. In
that situation, learning is in principle possible, since the training set does
capture the defining properties, respectively dissimilarities, of the target
classes. But directly training a CNN to predict class probabilities is prone to
overfitting to irrelevant correlations between the class labels and the
specific subset of the target class that is represented in the training set. We
explore the idea to instead learn a Siamese CNN that acts as similarity
function between pairs of training examples. Class predictions are then
obtained by measuring the similarities between a new test instance and the
training samples. We show that the CNN embedding correctly recovers the
relative similarities to arbitrary class exemplars in the training set. And
that therefore few, randomly picked training exemplars are sufficient to
achieve good predictions, making the procedure efficient.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

directional PointNet can classify daily terrains, including level ground, up
stairs, and down stairs, and the classification accuracy achieves 99% for

On the classification and false alarm of invalid prefixes in RPKI based BGP route origin validation,"Wenjie Xu, Deliang Chang, Xing Li","BGP is the default inter-domain routing protocol in today's Internet, but has

Domain Generalization by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles,"Fabio Maria Carlucci, Antonio D'Innocente, Silvia Bucci, Barbara Caputo, Tatiana Tommasi","Human adaptability relies crucially on the ability to learn and merge
knowledge both from supervised and unsupervised learning: the parents point out
few important concepts, but then the children fill in the gaps on their own.
This is particularly effective, because supervised learning can never be
exhaustive and thus learning autonomously allows to discover invariances and
regularities that help to generalize. In this paper we propose to apply a
similar approach to the task of object recognition across domains: our model
learns the semantic labels in a supervised fashion, and broadens its
understanding of the data by learning from self-supervised signals how to solve
a jigsaw puzzle on the same images. This secondary task helps the network to
learn the concepts of spatial correlation while acting as a regularizer for the
classification task. Multiple experiments on the PACS, VLCS, Office-Home and

Notions of Centralized and Decentralized Opacity in Linear Systems,"Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Rance Cleaveland, Steven I. Marcus","We formulate notions of opacity for cyberphysical systems modeled as
discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. A set of secret states is $k$-ISO
with respect to a set of nonsecret states if, starting from these sets at time
$0$, the outputs at time $k$ are indistinguishable to an adversarial observer.
Necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a secret specification is
$k$-ISO are established in terms of sets of reachable states. We also show how
to adapt techniques for computing under-approximations and over-approximations
of the set of reachable states of dynamical systems in order to soundly
approximate k-ISO. Further, we provide a condition for output controllability,
if $k$-ISO holds, and show that the converse holds under an additional
assumption.
We extend the theory of opacity for single-adversary systems to the case of
multiple adversaries and develop several notions of decentralized opacity. We
study the following scenarios: i) the presence or lack of a centralized
coordinator, and ii) the presence or absence of collusion among adversaries. In
the case of colluding adversaries, we derive a condition for nonopacity that
depends on the structure of the directed graph representing the communication
between adversaries.
Finally, we relax the condition that the outputs be indistinguishable and
define a notion of $\epsilon$-opacity, and also provide an extension to the

defender policy to maximize satisfaction of a given temporal logic
specification under any adversary policy. We relate the satisfaction of the

Ontology Based Global and Collective Motion Patterns for Event Classification in Basketball Videos,"Lifang Wu, Zhou Yang, Jiaoyu He, Meng Jian, Yaowen Xu, Dezhong Xu, Chang Wen Chen","In multi-person videos, especially team sport videos, a semantic event is
usually represented as a confrontation between two teams of players, which can
be represented as collective motion. In broadcast basketball videos, specific
camera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event
in broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion
(camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball
videos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence
(event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global
and collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event
classification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is
proposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme
progressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on
event-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both
algorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features
of GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to
predict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames
(RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and
success/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final
results. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called
NCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the
fixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic
events. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
the mean average precision of 58.10% on NCAA+. It is higher by 6.50% than

Recover and RELAX: Concern-Oriented Software Architecture Recovery for Systems Development and Maintenance,"Daniel Link, Pooyan Behnamghader, Ramin Moazeni, Barry Boehm","The stakeholders of a system are legitimately interested in whether and how
its architecture reflects their respective concerns at each point of its
development and maintenance processes. Having such knowledge available at all
times would enable them to continually adjust their systems structure at each
juncture and reduce the buildup of technical debt that can be hard to reduce
once it has persisted over many iterations. Unfortunately, software systems
often lack reliable and current documentation about their architecture. In
order to remedy this situation, researchers have conceived a number of
architectural recovery methods, some of them concern-oriented. However, the
design choices forming the bases of most existing recovery methods make it so
none of them have a complete set of desirable qualities for the purpose stated
above. Tailoring a recovery to a system is either not possible or only through
iterative experiments with numeric parameters. Furthermore, limitations in
their scalability make it prohibitive to apply the existing techniques to large
systems. Finally, since several current recovery methods employ
non-deterministic sampling, their inconsistent results do not lend themselves
well to tracking a systems course over several versions, as needed by its
stakeholders. RELAX (RELiable Architecture EXtraction), a new concern-based
recovery method that uses text classification, addresses these issues
efficiently by (1) assembling the overall recovery result from smaller,
independent parts, (2) basing it on an algorithm with linear time complexity
and (3) being tailorable to the recovery of a single system or a sequence
thereof through the selection of meaningfully named, semantic topics. An

During the past decades, different techniques have been proposed for

shallow or deep neural networks to the ranking problem in IR, referred to as

the ability to learn from the raw text inputs for the ranking problem to avoid
many limitations of hand-crafted features. Neural networks have sufficient
capacity to model complicated tasks, which is needed to handle the complexity
of relevance estimation in ranking. Since there have been a large variety of
neural ranking models proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize
the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights

k-Means Clustering of Lines for Big Data,"Yair Marom, Dan Feldman","The input to the $k$-median for lines problem is a set $L$ of $n$ lines in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, and the goal is to compute a set of $k$ centers (points) in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ that minimizes the sum of squared distances over every line in
$L$ and its nearest center. This is a straightforward generalization of the
$k$-median problem where the input is a set of $n$ points instead of lines.
We suggest the first PTAS that computes a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to
this problem in time $O(n \log n)$ for any constant approximation error
$\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, and constant integers $k, d \geq 1$. This is by proving
that there is always a weighted subset (called coreset) of $dk^{O(k)}\log
(n)/\epsilon^2$ lines in $L$ that approximates the sum of squared distances
from $L$ to any given set of $k$ points.
Using traditional merge-and-reduce technique, this coreset implies results
for a streaming set (possibly infinite) of lines to $M$ machines in one pass
(e.g. cloud) using memory, update time and communication that is
near-logarithmic in $n$, as well as deletion of any line but using linear
space. These results generalized for other distance functions such as
$k$-median (sum of distances) or ignoring farthest $m$ lines from the given
centers to handle outliers.

algorithm performs well in practice. Open source code for all the algorithms
and experiments is also provided.

Real time backbone for semantic segmentation,"Zhengeng Yang, Hongshan Yu, Qiang Fu, Wei Sun, Wenyan Jia, Mingui Sun, Zhi-Hong Mao","The rapid development of autonomous driving in recent years presents lots of

inefficiency problem and can hardly applied to practical applications. In this
paper, we systematically analyze the computation cost of Convolutional Neural

wide structure rather than the deep structure. In addition, the success of
pruning based model compression methods proved that there are many redundant

Spatiotemporal Feature Learning for Event-Based Vision,"Rohan Ghosh, Anupam Gupta, Siyi Tang, Alcimar Soares, Nitish Thakor","Unlike conventional frame-based sensors, event-based visual sensors output
information through spikes at a high temporal resolution. By only encoding
changes in pixel intensity, they showcase a low-power consuming, low-latency
approach to visual information sensing. To use this information for higher
sensory tasks like object recognition and tracking, an essential simplification
step is the extraction and learning of features. An ideal feature descriptor
must be robust to changes involving (i) local transformations and (ii)
re-appearances of a local event pattern. To that end, we propose a novel
spatiotemporal feature representation learning algorithm based on slow feature
analysis (SFA). Using SFA, smoothly changing linear projections are learnt
which are robust to local visual transformations. In order to determine if the
features can learn to be invariant to various visual transformations, feature
point tracking tasks are used for evaluation. Extensive experiments across two
datasets demonstrate the adaptability of the spatiotemporal feature learner to
translation, scaling and rotational transformations of the feature points. More
importantly, we find that the obtained feature representations are able to
exploit the high temporal resolution of such event-based cameras in generating
better feature tracks.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 16 Mar 2019]
Zero Forcing Detection For Short Packet Transmission Under Channel Estimation Errors,"Nikolaos I. Miridakis, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Hui-Ming Wang","A multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication system is
analytically studied under the short-packet transmission regime. The practical
scenario of channel estimation errors is adopted when the signals undergo
Rayleigh channel fading conditions. Unlike most previous works, the channel
estimation error term is treated as a signal rather than interference or noise,
which may further enhance the overall system performance. The spatial
multiplexing mode of transmit operation is considered, while the zero-forcing
detection is applied at the receiver. New and exact closed-form expressions for
the outage probability and total system goodput are derived. Capitalizing on
the analytical results, some new engineering insights are also presented; such
as the impact of channel estimation errors with respect to the number of

Pythia: a Framework for the Automated Analysis of Web Hosting Environments,"Srdjan Matic, Gareth Tyson, Gianluca Stringhini","A common approach when setting up a website is to utilize third party Web
hosting and content delivery networks. Without taking this trend into account,
any measurement study inspecting the deployment and operation of websites can

tools that can be used to identify how and where a given website is hosted.
Instead, a number of ad hoc techniques have emerged, e.g., using Autonomous
System databases, domain prefixes for CNAME records. In this work we propose
Pythia, a novel lightweight approach for identifying Web content hosted on
third-party infrastructures, including both traditional Web hosts and content
delivery networks. Our framework identifies the organization to which a given
Web page belongs, and it detects which Web servers are self-hosted and which
ones leverage third-party services to provide contents. To test our framework
we run it on 40,000 URLs and evaluate its accuracy, both by comparing the
results with similar services and with a manually validated groundtruth. Our

Improving Lemmatization of Non-Standard Languages with Joint Learning,"Enrique Manjavacas, Ákos Kádár, Mike Kestemont","Lemmatization of standard languages is concerned with (i) abstracting over
morphological differences and (ii) resolving token-lemma ambiguities of
inflected words in order to map them to a dictionary headword. In the present
paper we aim to improve lemmatization performance on a set of non-standard
historical languages in which the difficulty is increased by an additional
aspect (iii): spelling variation due to lacking orthographic standards. We
approach lemmatization as a string-transduction task with an encoder-decoder
architecture which we enrich with sentence context information using a
hierarchical sentence encoder. We show significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art when training the sentence encoder jointly for lemmatization
and language modeling. Crucially, our architecture does not require POS or
morphological annotations, which are not always available for historical
corpora. Additionally, we also test the proposed model on a set of
typologically diverse standard languages showing results on par or better than

Unsupervised Part-Based Disentangling of Object Shape and Appearance,"Dominik Lorenz, Leonard Bereska, Timo Milbich, Björn Ommer","Large intra-class variation is the result of changes in multiple object
characteristics. Images, however, only show the superposition of different
variable factors such as appearance or shape. Therefore, learning to
disentangle and represent these different characteristics poses a great
challenge, especially in the unsupervised case. Moreover, large object
articulation calls for a flexible part-based model. We present an unsupervised
approach for disentangling appearance and shape by learning parts consistently
over all instances of a category. Our model for learning an object
representation is trained by simultaneously exploiting invariance and
equivariance constraints between synthetically transformed images. Since no
part annotation or prior information on an object class is required, the
approach is applicable to arbitrary classes. We evaluate our approach on a wide
range of object categories and diverse tasks including pose prediction,
disentangled image synthesis, and video-to-video translation. The approach

Hand range of motion evaluation for Rheumatoid Arthritis patients,"Luciano Walenty Xavier Cejnog, Roberto Marcondes Cesar Jr., Teofilo Emidio de Campos, Valeria Meirelles Carril Elui","We introduce a framework for dynamic evaluation of the fingers movements:
flexion, extension, abduction and adduction. This framework estimates angle
measurements from joints computed by a hand pose estimation algorithm using a
depth sensor (Realsense SR300). Given depth maps as input, our framework uses
Pose-REN, which is a state-of-art hand pose estimation method that estimates 3D
hand joint positions using a deep convolutional neural network. The pose
estimation algorithm runs in real-time, allowing users to visualise 3D skeleton
tracking results at the same time as the depth images are acquired. Once 3D
joint poses are obtained, our framework estimates a plane containing the wrist
and MCP joints and measures flexion/extension and abduction/aduction angles by
applying computational geometry operations with respect to this plane. We
analysed flexion and abduction movement patterns using real data, extracting
the movement trajectories. Our preliminary results show that this method allows
an automatic discrimination of hands with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and healthy
patients. The angle between joints can be used as an indicative of current
movement capabilities and function. Although the measurements can be noisy and
less accurate than those obtained statically through goniometry, the
acquisition is much easier, non-invasive and patient-friendly, which shows the
potential of our approach. The system can be used with and without orthosis.

Feather: A Feature Model Transformation Language,Ahmet Serkan Karataş,"Feature modeling has been a very popular approach for variability management
in software product lines. Building a feature model requires substantial domain
expertise, however, even experts cannot foresee all future possibilities.
Changing requirements can force a feature model to evolve in order to adapt to
the new conditions. Feather is a language to describe model transformations
that will evolve a feature model. This article presents the structure and
foundations of Feather. First, the language elements, which consist of
declarations to characterize the model to evolve and commands to manipulate its
structure, are introduced. Then, semantics grounding in feature model
properties are given for the commands in order to provide precise command
definitions. Next, an interpreter that can realize the transformations
described by the commands in a Feather script is presented. Finally,
effectiveness of the language is discussed using two realistic examples, where

Domain adaptation for holistic skin detection,"Aloisio Dourado, Frederico Guth, Teofilo Emidio de Campos, Li Weigang","Human skin detection in images is a widely studied topic of Computer Vision
for which it is commonly accepted that analysis of pixel color or local patches
may suffice. This is because skin regions appear to be relatively uniform and
many argue that there is a small chromatic variation among different samples.
However, we found that there are strong biases in the datasets commonly used to
train or tune skin detection methods. Furthermore, the lack of contextual
information may hinder the performance of local approaches. In this paper we
present a comprehensive evaluation of holistic and local Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) approaches on in-domain and cross-domain experiments and compare
with state-of-the-art pixel-based approaches. We also propose a combination of
inductive transfer learning and unsupervised domain adaptation methods, which

Prescribed-time convergence with input constraints: A control Lyapunov function based approach,"Kunal Garg, Ehsan Arabi, Dimitra Panagou","In this paper, we present a control framework for a general class of
control-affine nonlinear systems under spatiotemporal and input constraints.
Specifically, the proposed control architecture addresses the problem of
reaching a given final set $S$ in a prescribed (user-defined) time with bounded
control inputs. To this end, a time transformation technique is utilized to
transform the system subject to temporal constraints into an equivalent form
without temporal constraints. The transformation is defined so that asymptotic
convergence in the transformed time scale results into prescribed-time
convergence in the original time scale. To incorporate input constraints, we
characterize a set of initial conditions $D_M$ such that starting from this
set, the closed-loop trajectories reach the set $S$ within the prescribed time.
We further show that starting from outside the set $D_M$, the system
trajectories reach the set $D_M$ in a finite time that depends upon the initial
conditions and the control input bounds. We use a novel parameter $\mu$ in the
controller, that controls the convergence-rate of the closed-loop trajectories

A Principal-Agent Model of Systems Engineering Processes with Application to Satellite Design,"Salar Safarkhani, Vikranth Reddy Kattakuri, Ilias Bilionis, Jitesh Panchal","We present a principal-agent model of a one-shot, shallow, systems
engineering process. The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions are
made during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to a
one-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems
engineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each
subsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem
engineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal of
the systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing
the subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based
system-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the
design requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of an
Earth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines the
optimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the
propulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of
a systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements and
incentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficulty
and associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and
subsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the
systems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the model
predicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirements
are higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability of
failure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for
large task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than the
true ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation.",Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),,[Submitted on 16 Mar 2019]
Token Swapping on Trees,"Ahmad Biniaz, Kshitij Jain, Anna Lubiw, Zuzana Masárová, Tillmann Miltzow, Debajyoti Mondal, Anurag Murty Naredla, Josef Tkadlec, Alexi Turcotte","The input to the token swapping problem is a graph with vertices $v_1, v_2,

The goal is to get token $i$ to vertex $v_i$ for all $i= 1, \ldots, n$ using a
minimum number of \emph{swaps}, where a swap exchanges the tokens on the
endpoints of an edge.
Token swapping on a tree, also known as ""sorting with a transposition tree"",

1. An optimum swap sequence may need to perform a swap on a leaf vertex that
has the correct token (a ""happy leaf""), disproving a conjecture of Vaughan.
2. Any algorithm that fixes happy leaves---as all known approximation
algorithms for the problem do---has approximation factor at least $4/3$.
Furthermore, the two best-known 2-approximation algorithms have approximation
factor exactly 2.
3. A generalized problem---weighted coloured token swapping---is NP-complete
on trees, but solvable in polynomial time on paths and stars. In this version,
tokens and vertices have colours, and colours have weights. The goal is to get

Visual Query Answering by Entity-Attribute Graph Matching and Reasoning,"Peixi Xiong, Huayi Zhan, Xin Wang, Baivab Sinha, Ying Wu","Visual Query Answering (VQA) is of great significance in offering people
convenience: one can raise a question for details of objects, or high-level
understanding about the scene, over an image. This paper proposes a novel
method to address the VQA problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that
targets single scene VQA, replies on graph-based techniques and involves
reasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first
graph, referred to as inference graph GI , is constructed via learning over
labeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph Q and
entity-attribute graph GEA, are generated from natural language query Qnl and
image Img, that are issued from users, respectively. As GEA often does not take
sufficient information to answer Q, we develop techniques to infer missing
information of GEA with GI . Based on GEA and Q, we provide techniques to find
matches of Q in GEA, as the answer of Qnl in Img. Unlike commonly used VQA
methods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method
shows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable. We

GFD-SSD: Gated Fusion Double SSD for Multispectral Pedestrian Detection,"Yang Zheng, Izzat H. Izzat, Shahrzad Ziaee","Pedestrian detection is an essential task in autonomous driving research. In
addition to typical color images, thermal images benefit the detection in dark

advantage of both color and thermal images simultaneously. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to fuse color and thermal sensors using deep neural

We show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given graph $G$ admits a

Zeno++: Robust Fully Asynchronous SGD,"Cong Xie, Sanmi Koyejo, Indranil Gupta","We propose Zeno++, a new robust asynchronous Stochastic Gradient
Descent~(SGD) procedure which tolerates Byzantine failures of the workers. In
contrast to previous work, Zeno++ removes some unrealistic restrictions on
worker-server communications, allowing for fully asynchronous updates from
anonymous workers, arbitrarily stale worker updates, and the possibility of an
unbounded number of Byzantine workers. The key idea is to estimate the descent
of the loss value after the candidate gradient is applied, where large descent
values indicate that the update results in optimization progress. We prove the
convergence of Zeno++ for non-convex problems under Byzantine failures.
Experimental results show that Zeno++ outperforms existing approaches.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)","[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 26 Sep 2019 (this version, v4)]"
Responses to a Critique of Artificial Moral Agents,"Adam Poulsen, Michael Anderson, Susan L. Anderson, Ben Byford, Fabio Fossa, Erica L. Neely, Alejandro Rosas, Alan Winfield","The field of machine ethics is concerned with the question of how to embed
ethical behaviors, or a means to determine ethical behaviors, into artificial
intelligence (AI) systems. The goal is to produce artificial moral agents
(AMAs) that are either implicitly ethical (designed to avoid unethical
consequences) or explicitly ethical (designed to behave ethically). Van
Wynsberghe and Robbins' (2018) paper Critiquing the Reasons for Making
Artificial Moral Agents critically addresses the reasons offered by machine
ethicists for pursuing AMA research; this paper, co-authored by machine
ethicists and commentators, aims to contribute to the machine ethics
conversation by responding to that critique. The reasons for developing AMAs
discussed in van Wynsberghe and Robbins (2018) are: it is inevitable that they
will be developed; the prevention of harm; the necessity for public trust; the
prevention of immoral use; such machines are better moral reasoners than
humans, and building these machines would lead to a better understanding of
human morality. In this paper, each co-author addresses those reasons in turn.
In so doing, this paper demonstrates that the reasons critiqued are not shared
by all co-authors; each machine ethicist has their own reasons for researching
AMAs. But while we express a diverse range of views on each of the six reasons
in van Wynsberghe and Robbins' critique, we nevertheless share the opinion that
the scientific study of AMAs has considerable value.",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),; Computers and Society (cs.CY); Robotics (cs.RO),[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]
Integral Input-to-State Stability of Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems with Delay-Dependent Impulse Effects,Kexue Zhang,"This paper studies integral input-to-state stability (iISS) of nonlinear
impulsive systems with time-delay in both the continuous dynamics and the
impulses. Several iISS results are established by using the method of
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. For impulsive systems with iISS continuous
dynamics and destabilizing impulses, we derive two iISS criteria that guarantee
the uniform iISS of the whole system provided that the time period between two
successive impulse moments is appropriately bounded from below. Then we provide
an iISS result for systems with unstable continuous dynamics and stabilizing
impulses. For this scenario, it is shown that the iISS properties are
guaranteed if the impulses occur frequently enough. For impulsive systems with
stabilizing impulses and stable continuous dynamics for zero input, we obtain
an iISS result which shows that the entire system is uniformly iISS over
arbitrary impulse time sequences. As applications, iISS properties of a class

Computing Maximum Independent Set on Outerstring Graphs and Their Relatives,"Prosenjit Bose, Paz Carmi, J. Mark Keil, Anil Maheshwari, Saeed Mehrabi, Debajyoti Mondal, Michiel Smid","A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is called an outerstring graph if it has an
intersection representation of a set of $n$ curves inside a disk such that one
endpoint of every curve is attached to the boundary of the disk. Given an
outerstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem of
the underlying graph can be solved in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number of
segments in the representation (Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25, 2017).
If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments, L-shapes, etc.), then
the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time.
In this paper, we examine the fine-grained complexity of the MIS problem on
some well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving the MIS
problem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least
as hard as solving MIS on circle graph representations. Note that no
$O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm, $\delta>0$, is known for the MIS problem on
circle graphs. For the grounded string representations where the strings are
$y$-monotone simple polygonal paths of constant length with segments at
integral coordinates, we solve MIS in $O(n^2)$ time and show this to be the
best possible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). For the
intersection graph of $n$ L-shapes in the plane, we give a $(4\cdot \log
OPT)$-approximation algorithm for MIS (where $OPT$ denotes the size of an
optimal solution), improving the previously best-known $(4\cdot \log
n)$-approximation algorithm of Biedl and Derka (WADS 2017).",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]
VeriSFQ - A Semi-formal Verification Framework and Benchmark for Single Flux Quantum Technology,"Alvin D. Wong, Kevin Su, Hang Sun, Arash Fayyazi, Massoud Pedram, Shahin Nazarian","In this paper, we propose a semi-formal verification framework for
single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits called VeriSFQ, using the Universal
Verification Methodology (UVM) standard. The considered SFQ technology is
superconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic
temperatures with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which
operate at high switching speeds and low switching energy - allowing SFQ
circuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due to key differences
between SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as
advanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification
techniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework
focuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of SFQ logic:
fanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The
combinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are:
Kogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select
ISCAS'85 combinational benchmark circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ
circuit designs for verification detection were experimented with - including
stuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional bugs like
incorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark
consisting of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties
and present the performance of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark
circuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM standard allows the
VeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal
verification techniques.",Emerging Technologies (cs.ET),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]

TurkScanner: Predicting the Hourly Wage of Microtasks,"Susumu Saito, Chun-Wei Chiang, Saiph Savage, Teppei Nakano, Tetsunori Kobayashi, Jeffrey Bigham","Workers in crowd markets struggle to earn a living. One reason for this is
that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of
microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In
general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left
to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of
the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting
the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data
collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following
contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training
data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them;
(ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary
working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected
hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension
installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of
accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers.
TurkScanner was created using ~150 derived features, and was able to predict
the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error.
Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on
people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for
better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the
acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]
Impact of Contextual Factors on Snapchat Public Sharing,"Hana Habib, Neil Shah, Rajan Vaish","Public sharing is integral to online platforms. This includes the popular
multimedia messaging application Snapchat, on which public sharing is
relatively new and unexplored in prior research. In mobile-first applications,
sharing contexts are dynamic. However, it is unclear how context impacts users'
sharing decisions. As platforms increasingly rely on user-generated content, it
is important to also broadly understand user motivations and considerations in
public sharing. We explored these aspects of content sharing through a survey
of 1,515 Snapchat users. Our results indicate that users primarily have
intrinsic motivations for publicly sharing Snaps, such as to share an
experience with the world, but also have considerations related to audience and
sensitivity of content. Additionally, we found that Snaps shared publicly were
contextually different from those privately shared. Our findings suggest that
content sharing systems can be designed to support sharing motivations, yet
also be sensitive to private contexts.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]
Time Synchronization Attack and Countermeasure for Multi-System Scheduling in Remote Estimation,"Ziyang Guo, Yuqing Ni, Wing Shing Wong, Ling Shi","We consider time synchronization attack against multi-system scheduling in a
remote state estimation scenario where a number of sensors monitor different
linear dynamical processes and schedule their transmissions through a shared

the sensors, the malicious attacker is able to make the expected estimation
error covariance of the overall system diverge without any system knowledge.
For the case that the attacker has full system information, we propose an
efficient algorithm to calculate the optimal attack, which spoofs the least
number of sensors and leads to unbounded average estimation error covariance.
To mitigate the attack consequence, we further propose a countermeasure by
constructing shift invariant transmission policies and characterize the lower
and upper bounds for system estimation performance. Simulation examples are

characteristics of the runtime environment, such as energy consumption and
throughput. We claim that these purely dynamic techniques can be improved if
they are aware of the program's syntactic structure. To support this claim, we
show how to use the compiler to partition source code into program phases:
regions whose syntactic characteristics lead to similar runtime behavior. We
use reinforcement learning to map pairs formed by a program phase and a
hardware state to the configuration that best fit this setup. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our ideas, we have implemented the Astro system. Astro

Discriminating Original Region from Duplicated One in Copy-Move Forgery,"Saba Salehi, Ahmad Mahmoodi-Aznaveh","Since images are used as evidence in many cases, validation of digital images
is essential. Copy-move forgery is a special kind of manipulation in which some
parts of an image is copied and pasted into another part of the same image.
Various methods have been proposed to detect copy-move forgery, which have
achieved promising results. In previous methods, a binary mask determining the
original and forged region is presented as the final result. However, it is not
specified which part of the mask is the forged region. It should be noted that
discriminating the original region from the duplicated one is not usually
feasible by human visual system(HVS). On the other hand, exact localizing the
forged region can be helpful for automatic forgery detection especially in
combined forgeries. In real-world forgeries, some manipulations are performed
in order to provide a visibly realistic scene. These modifications are usually
applied on the boundary of the duplicated snippets. In this research, the
texture information of the border regions of both the original and copied
patches have been statistically investigated. Based on this analysis, we
propose a method to discriminated copied snippets from original ones. In order
to validate our method, GRIP dataset is utilized since it contains more

Deep Feature Selection using a Teacher-Student Network,"Ali Mirzaei, Vahid Pourahmadi, Mehran Soltani, Hamid Sheikhzadeh","High-dimensional data in many machine learning applications leads to
computational and analytical complexities. Feature selection provides an
effective way for solving these problems by removing irrelevant and redundant
features, thus reducing model complexity and improving accuracy and
generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel
teacher-student feature selection (TSFS) method in which a 'teacher' (a deep
neural network or a complicated dimension reduction method) is first employed
to learn the best representation of data in low dimension. Then a 'student'
network (a simple neural network) is used to perform feature selection by
minimizing the reconstruction error of low dimensional representation. Although
the teacher-student scheme is not new, to the best of our knowledge, it is the
first time that this scheme is employed for feature selection. The proposed
TSFS can be used for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. This
method is evaluated on different datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art

General techniques for approximate incidences and their application to the camera posing problem,"Dror Aiger, Haim Kaplan, Efi Kokiopoulou, Micha Sharir, Bernhard Zeisl","We consider the classical camera pose estimation problem that arises in many
computer vision applications, in which we are given n 2D-3D correspondences
between points in the scene and points in the camera image (some of which are
incorrect associations), and where we aim to determine the camera pose (the
position and orientation of the camera in the scene) from this data. We
demonstrate that this posing problem can be reduced to the problem of computing
{\epsilon}-approximate incidences between two-dimensional surfaces (derived
from the input correspondences) and points (on a grid) in a four-dimensional
pose space. Similar reductions can be applied to other camera pose problems, as
well as to similar problems in related application areas. We describe and
analyze three techniques for solving the resulting {\epsilon}-approximate
incidences problem in the context of our camera posing application. The first
is a straightforward assignment of surfaces to the cells of a grid (of
side-length {\epsilon}) that they intersect. The second is a variant of a
primal-dual technique, recently introduced by a subset of the authors [2] for
different (and simpler) applications. The third is a non-trivial generalization
of a data structure Fonseca and Mount [3], originally designed for the case of
hyperplanes. We present and analyze this technique in full generality, and then
apply it to the camera posing problem at hand. We compare our methods

Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks for Time Series Classification,"Hassan Ismail Fawaz, Germain Forestier, Jonathan Weber, Lhassane Idoumghar, Pierre-Alain Muller","Time Series Classification (TSC) problems are encountered in many real life
data mining tasks ranging from medicine and security to human activity

various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing,
researchers started adopting these techniques for solving time series data
mining problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has
considered the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial time series
examples, which could potentially make them unreliable in situations where the
decision taken by the classifier is crucial such as in medicine and security.
For computer vision problems, such attacks have been shown to be very easy to
perform by altering the image and adding an imperceptible amount of noise to
trick the network into wrongly classifying the input image. Following this line
of work, we propose to leverage existing adversarial attack mechanisms to add a
special noise to the input time series in order to decrease the network's

Learning Competitive and Discriminative Reconstructions for Anomaly Detection,"Kai Tian, Shuigeng Zhou, Jianping Fan, Jihong Guan","Most of the existing methods for anomaly detection use only positive data to

Spatiotemporal Filtering for Event-Based Action Recognition,"Rohan Ghosh, Anupam Gupta, Andrei Nakagawa, Alcimar Soares, Nitish Thakor","In this paper, we address the challenging problem of action recognition,
using event-based cameras. To recognise most gestural actions, often higher
temporal precision is required for sampling visual information. Actions are
defined by motion, and therefore, when using event-based cameras it is often
unnecessary to re-sample the entire scene. Neuromorphic, event-based cameras
have presented an alternative to visual information acquisition by
asynchronously time-encoding pixel intensity changes, through temporally
precise spikes (10 micro-second resolution), making them well equipped for
action recognition. However, other challenges exist, which are intrinsic to
event-based imagers, such as higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a
spatiotemporally sparse information. One option is to convert event-data into
frames, but this could result in significant temporal precision loss. In this
work we introduce spatiotemporal filtering in the spike-event domain, as an
alternative way of channeling spatiotemporal information through to a
convolutional neural network. The filters are local spatiotemporal weight
matrices, learned from the spike-event data, in an unsupervised manner. We find
that appropriate spatiotemporal filtering significantly improves CNN
performance beyond state-of-the-art on the event-based DVS Gesture dataset. On
our newly recorded action recognition dataset, our method shows significant
improvement when compared with other, standard ways of generating the

Few studies, especially on deep learning, have focused on matching partial
person images with holistic person images. This study presents a novel deep

features of the holistic, partial, and affined images. Competition (or

two-stage training is applied to acquire a strong STNReID for partial ReID.

computational performance against the state-of-the-art time series algorithms,
including a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network and DeepAR (industry
standard deep learning library by Amazon). Statistically, on standard time

relative accuracy. Computationally, TSPS is 59-62x and 94-95x faster compared
to LSTM and DeepAR in terms of median ML model training time and prediction
query latency, respectively. Further, compared to PostgreSQL's bulk insert time
and its SELECT query latency, TSPS is slower only by 1.3x and 2.6x
respectively. That is, TSPS is a real-time prediction system in that its model
training / prediction query time is similar to just inserting / reading data

Inducing Mimicry Through Auditory Icons,"Hanif Baharin, Norhayati Yusof, Suzilah Ismail","This study aims to find out if periodic auditory icon loop and non-periodic
auditory icon loop can induce mimicry in humans. Auditory icons are snippet of
everyday sounds used to represent information or processes. A within-subject,
Oz-of-Wizard experiment was conducted among forty participants. The
participants were asked to eat an apple while being exposed to different types
of auditory icon loop. The loops were made using an auditory icon that plays
the sound of crunchy apple bite. Both male and female participants were exposed
to periodic auditory icon loop, with the auditory icon played every 10 second.
Participants were also exposed to non-periodic auditory icon loop which uses
the same auditory icon but was made to represent the eating behaviour of a real
person of the same sex. The results show that only male participants mimicked
the male non-periodic auditory icon loop. Although female participants mimicked
the female auditory icon loop, the result is not significant. Both male and
female did not mimic the periodic auditory icon loop. Thus, only auditory icons
that represent normal biting pace can induce mimicry, significantly in male
participants. The findings from this study has implications on the design of
persuasive technology that uses auditory icons to encourage behavioural change.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]
Question Answering via Web Extracted Tables and Pipelined Models,"Bhavya Karki, Fan Hu, Nithin Haridas, Suhail Barot, Zihua Liu, Lucile Callebert, Matthias Grabmair, Anthony Tomasic","In this paper, we describe a dataset and baseline result for a question

"No Delay: Latency-Driven, Application Performance-Aware, Cluster Scheduling","Diana Andreea Popescu, Andrew W. Moore","Given the network latency variability observed in data centers, applications'
performance is also determined by their placement within the data centre. We
present NoMora, a cluster scheduling architecture whose core is represented by
a latency-driven, application performance-aware, cluster scheduling policy. The
policy places the tasks of an application taking into account the expected
performance based on the measured network latency between pairs of hosts in the
data center. Furthermore, if a tenant's application experiences increased
network latency, and thus lower application performance, their application may
be migrated to a better placement. Preliminary results show that our policy
improves the overall average application performance by up to 13.4% and by up
to 42% if preemption is enabled, and improves the task placement latency by a
factor of 1.79x and the median algorithm runtime by 1.16x compared to a random

By gaining control and visibility of the network stack, operator can perform
network management more directly and flexibly, such as multiplexing VMs running
different applications to the same network stack module to save CPU cores, and
enforcing fair bandwidth sharing with distributed congestion control. Users
also benefit from the simplified stack deployment and better performance. For
example mTCP can be deployed without API change to support nginx natively, and

Convergence Theory of Learning Over-parameterized ResNet: A Full Characterization,"Huishuai Zhang, Da Yu, Mingyang Yi, Wei Chen, Tie-Yan Liu","ResNet structure has achieved great empirical success since its debut. Recent
work established the convergence of learning over-parameterized ResNet with a
scaling factor $\tau=1/L$ on the residual branch where $L$ is the network
depth. However, it is not clear how learning ResNet behaves for other values of
$\tau$. In this paper, we fully characterize the convergence theory of gradient
descent for learning over-parameterized ResNet with different values of $\tau$.
Specifically, with hiding logarithmic factor and constant coefficients, we show
that for $\tau\le 1/\sqrt{L}$ gradient descent is guaranteed to converge to the
global minma, and especially when $\tau\le 1/L$ the convergence is irrelevant
of the network depth. Conversely, we show that for $\tau>L^{-\frac{1}{2}+c}$,
the forward output grows at least with rate $L^c$ in expectation and then the
learning fails because of gradient explosion for large $L$. This means the
bound $\tau\le 1/\sqrt{L}$ is sharp for learning ResNet with arbitrary depth.

Human-Misinformation interaction: Understanding the interdisciplinary approach needed to computationally combat false information,Alireza Karduni,"The prevalence of new technologies and social media has amplified the effects
of misinformation on our societies. Thus, it is necessary to create
computational tools to mitigate their effects effectively. This study aims to
provide a critical overview of computational approaches concerned with
combating misinformation. To this aim, I offer an overview of scholarly
definitions of misinformation. I adopt a framework for studying misinformation
that suggests paying attention to the source, content, and consumers as the
three main elements involved in the process of misinformation and I provide an
overview of literature from disciplines of psychology, media studies, and
cognitive sciences that deal with each of these elements. Using the framework,
I overview the existing computational methods that deal with 1) misinformation
detection and fact-checking using Content 2) Identifying untrustworthy Sources

resilient to misinformation. I find that the vast majority of works in computer
science and information technology is concerned with the crucial tasks of
detection and verification of content and sources of misinformation. Moreover,
I find that computational research focusing on Consumers of Misinformation in
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related fields are very sparse and often
do not deal with the subtleties of this process. The majority of existing
interfaces and systems are less concerned with the usability of the tools

Evolving and Understanding Sparse Deep Neural Networks using Cosine Similarity,"Joost Pieterse, Decebal Constantin Mocanu","Training sparse neural networks with adaptive connectivity is an active
research topic. Such networks require less storage and have lower computational
complexity compared to their dense counterparts. The Sparse Evolutionary
Training (SET) procedure uses weights magnitude to evolve efficiently the
topology of a sparse network to fit the dataset, while enabling it to have
quadratically less parameters than its dense counterpart. To this end, we
propose a novel approach that evolves a sparse network topology based on the
behavior of neurons in the network. More exactly, the cosine similarities
between the activations of any two neurons are used to determine which
connections are added to or removed from the network. By integrating our
approach within the SET procedure, we propose 5 new algorithms to train sparse
neural networks. We argue that our approach has low additional computational
complexity and we draw a parallel to Hebbian learning. Experiments are
performed on 8 datasets taken from various domains to demonstrate the general
applicability of our approach. Even without optimizing hyperparameters for
specific datasets, the experiments show that our proposed training algorithms

SCALP: Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path,"Rémi Giraud, Vinh-Thong Ta, Nicolas Papadakis","Superpixel decomposition methods are generally used as a pre-processing step

1) computational time, 2) adherence to image contours and 3) regularity and
compactness of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a fast method to
compute Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP) in an
iterative clustering framework. The distance computed when trying to associate
a pixel to a superpixel during the clustering is enhanced by considering the
linear path to the superpixel barycenter. The proposed framework produces
regular and compact superpixels that adhere to the image contours. We provide a

Proximal Splitting Networks for Image Restoration,"Raied Aljadaany, Dipan K. Pal, Marios Savvides","Image restoration problems are typically ill-posed requiring the design of
suitable priors. These priors are typically hand-designed and are fully

framework for handling inverse problems related to image restoration based on
elements from the half quadratic splitting method and proximal operators.
Modeling the proximal operator as a convolutional network, we defined an
implicit prior on the image space as a function class during training. This is
in contrast to the common practice in literature of having the prior to be
fixed and fully instantiated even during training stages. Further, we allow
this proximal operator to be tuned differently for each iteration which greatly
increases modeling capacity and allows us to reduce the number of iterations by
an order of magnitude as compared to other approaches. Our final network is an
end-to-end one whose run time matches the previous fastest algorithms while
outperforming them in recovery fidelity on two image restoration tasks. Indeed,

Modeling and Optimization of Human-machine Interaction Processes via the Maximum Entropy Principle,"Jiaxiao Zheng, Gustavo de Veciana","We propose a data-driven framework to enable the modeling and optimization of
human-machine interaction processes, e.g., systems aimed at assisting humans in
decision-making or learning, work-load allocation, and interactive advertising.
This is a challenging problem for several reasons. First, humans' behavior is
hard to model or infer, as it may reflect biases, long term memory, and
sensitivity to sequencing, i.e., transience and exponential complexity in the
length of the interaction. Second, due to the interactive nature of such
processes, the machine policy used to engage with a human may bias possible
data-driven inferences. Finally, in choosing machine policies that optimize
interaction rewards, one must, on the one hand, avoid being overly sensitive to
error/variability in the estimated human model, and on the other, being overly
deterministic/predictable which may result in poor human 'engagement' in the
interaction. To meet these challenges, we propose a robust approach, based on
the maximum entropy principle, which iteratively estimates human behavior and
optimizes the machine policy--Alternating Entropy-Reward Ascent (AREA)

Evaluation Framework of Superpixel Methods with a Global Regularity Measure,"Rémi Giraud, Vinh-Thong Ta, Nicolas Papadakis","In the superpixel literature, the comparison of state-of-the-art methods can

measured performances. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework,
that aims to unify the comparison process of superpixel methods. We investigate
the limitations of existing metrics, and propose to evaluate each of the three
core decomposition aspects: color homogeneity, respect of image objects and
shape regularity. To measure the regularity aspect, we propose a new global
regularity measure (GR), which addresses the non-robustness of state-of-the-art
metrics. We evaluate recent superpixel methods with these criteria, at several
superpixel scales and regularity levels. The proposed framework reduces the

Training recurrent neural networks robust to incomplete data: application to Alzheimer's disease progression modeling,"Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi, Mads Nielsen, Akshay Pai, M. Jorge Cardoso, Marc Modat, Sebastien Ourselin, Lauge Sørensen","Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging
machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies
among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories,
do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects'

address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain
incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a
pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we
propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture,
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor

progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole
brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is

regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm
achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives
with p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost
all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly
larger AUC of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for
clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount

every day we use our smartphones for communication, entertainment, business and

stores and divided into 11 groups by types. These groups of data were used to
construct a Knowledge Schema - a graphic model of interconnections of data that

Weighted Mean Curvature,"Yuanhao Gong, Orcun Goksel","In image processing tasks, spatial priors are essential for robust
computations, regularization, algorithmic design and Bayesian inference. In
this paper, we introduce weighted mean curvature (WMC) as a novel image prior
and present an efficient computation scheme for its discretization in practical
image processing applications. We first demonstrate the favorable properties of
WMC, such as sampling invariance, scale invariance, and contrast invariance
with Gaussian noise model; and we show the relation of WMC to area
regularization. We further propose an efficient computation scheme for
discretized WMC, which is demonstrated herein to process over 33.2
giga-pixels/second on GPU. This scheme yields itself to a convolutional neural

Learning-Based Animation of Clothing for Virtual Try-On,"Igor Santesteban, Miguel A. Otaduy, Dan Casas","This paper presents a learning-based clothing animation method for highly
efficient virtual try-on simulation. Given a garment, we preprocess a rich
database of physically-based dressed character simulations, for multiple body
shapes and animations. Then, using this database, we train a learning-based
model of cloth drape and wrinkles, as a function of body shape and dynamics. We
propose a model that separates global garment fit, due to body shape, from
local garment wrinkles, due to both pose dynamics and body shape. We use a
recurrent neural network to regress garment wrinkles, and we achieve highly
plausible nonlinear effects, in contrast to the blending artifacts suffered by
previous methods. At runtime, dynamic virtual try-on animations are produced in
just a few milliseconds for garments with thousands of triangles. We show

Robust superpixels using color and contour features along linear path,"Rémi Giraud, Vinh-Thong Ta, Nicolas Papadakis","Superpixel decomposition methods are widely used in computer vision and image
processing applications. By grouping homogeneous pixels, the accuracy can be
increased and the decrease of the number of elements to process can drastically
reduce the computational burden. For most superpixel methods, a trade-off is
computed between 1) color homogeneity, 2) adherence to the image contours and
3) shape regularity of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a framework
that jointly enforces all these aspects and provides accurate and regular
Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP). During the
decomposition, we propose to consider color features along the linear path
between the pixel and the corresponding superpixel barycenter. A contour prior
is also used to prevent the crossing of image boundaries when associating a
pixel to a superpixel. Finally, in order to improve the decomposition accuracy
and the robustness to noise, we propose to integrate the pixel neighborhood
information, while preserving the same computational complexity. SCALP is
extensively evaluated on standard segmentation dataset, and the obtained
results outperform the ones of the state-of-the-art methods. SCALP is also
extended for supervoxel decomposition on MRI images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019]

On the Complexity of the k-Level in Arrangements of Pseudoplanes,"M. Sharir, C. Ziv","A classical open problem in combinatorial geometry is to obtain tight
asymptotic bounds on the maximum number of k-level vertices in an arrangement
of n hyperplanes in d dimensions (vertices with exactly k of the hyperplanes
passing below them). This is a dual version of the k-set problem, which, in a
primal setting, seeks bounds for the maximum number of k-sets determined by n
points in d dimensions, where a k-set is a subset of size k that can be
separated from its complement by a hyperplane. The k-set problem is still wide
open even in the plane, with a substantial gap between the best known upper and
lower bounds. The gap gets larger as the dimension grows. In three dimensions,
the best known upper bound is O(nk^(3/2)).
In its dual version, the problem can be generalized by replacing hyperplanes
by other families of surfaces (or curves in the planes). Reasonably sharp
bounds have been obtained for curves in the plane, but the known upper bounds
are rather weak for more general surfaces, already in three dimensions, except
for the case of triangles. The best known general bound, due to Chan is
O(n^2.997), for families of surfaces that satisfy certain (fairly weak)
properties.
In this paper we consider the case of pseudoplanes in 3 dimensions (defined
in detail in the introduction), and establish the upper bound O(nk^(5/3)) for
the number of k-level vertices in an arrangement of n pseudoplanes. The bound
is obtained by establishing suitable (and nontrivial) extensions of dual
versions of classical tools that have been used in studying the primal k-set
problem, such as the Lova'sz Lemma and the Crossing Lemma.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),,"[Submitted on 17 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 14 Mar 2020 (this version, v2)]"
Model-Free Model Reconciliation,"Sarath Sreedharan, Alberto Olmo, Aditya Prasad Mishra, Subbarao Kambhampati","Designing agents capable of explaining complex sequential decisions remain a
significant open problem in automated decision-making. Recently, there has been
a lot of interest in developing approaches for generating such explanations for
various decision-making paradigms. One such approach has been the idea of {\em
explanation as model-reconciliation}. The framework hypothesizes that one of
the common reasons for the user's confusion could be the mismatch between the
user's model of the task and the one used by the system to generate the
decisions. While this is a general framework, most works that have been
explicitly built on this explanatory philosophy have focused on settings where
the model of user's knowledge is available in a declarative form. Our goal in
this paper is to adapt the model reconciliation approach to the cases where
such user models are no longer explicitly provided. We present a simple and

AttoNets: Compact and Efficient Deep Neural Networks for the Edge via Human-Machine Collaborative Design,"Alexander Wong, Zhong Qiu Lin, Brendan Chwyl","While deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
a large number of complex tasks, it remains a big challenge to deploy such
networks for practical, on-device edge scenarios such as on mobile devices,
consumer devices, drones, and vehicles. In this study, we take a deeper
exploration into a human-machine collaborative design approach for creating
highly efficient deep neural networks through a synergy between principled
network design prototyping and machine-driven design exploration. The efficacy
of human-machine collaborative design is demonstrated through the creation of
AttoNets, a family of highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device edge
deep learning. Each AttoNet possesses a human-specified network-level
macro-architecture comprising of custom modules with unique machine-designed
module-level macro-architecture and micro-architecture designs, all driven by
human-specified design requirements. Experimental results for the task of
object recognition showed that the AttoNets created via human-machine

noticeably higher accuracy (with the smallest AttoNet achieving ~1.8% higher
accuracy while requiring ~10x fewer multiply-add operations and parameters than

the task of instance-level object segmentation and object detection, where an

Specification and Inference of Trace Refinement Relations,"Timos Antonopoulos, Eric Koskinen, Ton-Chanh Le","Modern software is constantly changing. Researchers and practitioners are
increasingly aware that verification tools can be impactful if they embrace
change through analyses that are compositional and span program versions.
Reasoning about similarities and differences between programs goes back to
Benton, who introduced state-based refinement relations, which were extended by
Yang and others. However, to our knowledge, refinement relations have not been
explored for traces.
We present a novel theory that allows one to perform compositional reasoning
about the similarities/differences between how fragments of two different
programs behave over time through the use of what we call trace-refinement
relations. We take a reactive view of programs and found Kleene Algebra with
Tests (KAT) [Kozen] to be a natural choice to describe traces since it permits
algebraic reasoning and has built-in composition. Our theory involves a
two-step semantic abstraction from programs to KAT, and then our trace
refinement relations correlate behaviors by (i) categorizing program behaviors
into trace classes through KAT intersection and (ii) correlating atomic
events/conditions across programs with KAT hypotheses. We next describe a
synthesis algorithm that iteratively constructs trace-refinement relations
between two programs by exploring sub-partitions of their traces, iteratively
abstracting them as KAT expressions, discovering relationships through a custom
edit-distance algorithm, and applying strategies (i) and (ii) above. We have
implemented this algorithm as {\sc knotical}, the first tool capable of
synthesizing trace-refinement relations. It built from the ground up in Ocaml,
using InterProc and SymKAT. We have demonstrated that useful relations can be
efficiently generated across a suite of 37 benchmarks that include changing
fragments of array programs, systems code, and web servers.",Programming Languages (cs.PL),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]

consider uncertainties in the full system dynamics, we employ Control Lyapunov
Functions (CLFs) as low-dimensional projections. To understand and characterize
the uncertainty that these projected dynamics introduce in the system, we
introduce a new notion: Projection to State Stability (PSS). PSS can be viewed
as a variant of Input to State Stability defined on projected dynamics, and
enables characterizing robustness of a CLF with respect to the data used to
learn system uncertainties. We use PSS to bound uncertainty in affine control,

Automatically applying a credibility appraisal tool to track vaccination-related communications shared on social media,"Zubair Shah, Didi Surian, Amalie Dyda, Enrico Coiera, Kenneth D. Mandl, Adam G. Dunn","Background: Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are
time-consuming to apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their
use for quickly identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation as it
emerges. Our aim was to estimate the proportion of vaccination-related posts on
Twitter are likely to be misinformation, and how unevenly exposure to
misinformation was distributed among Twitter users.
Methods: Sampling from 144,878 vaccination-related web pages shared on
Twitter between January 2017 and March 2018, we used a seven-point checklist
adapted from two validated tools to appraise the credibility of a small subset
of 474. These were used to train several classifiers (random forest, support
vector machines, and a recurrent neural network with transfer learning), using
the text from a web page to predict whether the information satisfies each of
the seven criteria.
Results: Applying the best performing classifier to the 144,878 web pages, we
found that 14.4\% of relevant posts to text-based communications were linked to
webpages of low credibility and made up 9.2\% of all potential
vaccination-related exposures. However, the 100 most popular links to
misinformation were potentially seen by between 2 million and 80 million
Twitter users, and for a substantial sub-population of Twitter users engaging
with vaccination-related information, links to misinformation appear to
dominate the vaccination-related information to which they were exposed.
Conclusions: We proposed a new method for automatically appraising the
credibility of webpages based on a combination of validated checklist tools.
The results suggest that an automatic credibility appraisal tool can be used to
find populations at higher risk of exposure to misinformation or applied
proactively to add friction to the sharing of low credibility vaccination

Multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments from wearable sensor accelerations via deep learning,"William R. Johnson, Ajmal Mian, Mark A. Robinson, Jasper Verheul, David G. Lloyd, Jacqueline A. Alderson","Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of
catastrophic non-contact knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom
early-warning detection system. This system must be able to estimate accurate,
reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near
real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to
laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly
trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and
wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new
method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Here we show that kinematic data
obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force
platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near
real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M).
Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained
using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor
accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a
million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model
driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent
inter-laboratory data capture sessions. The proposed deep learning workbench
achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of
vertical Fz 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87
(sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89,
and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). These best-case correlations indicate the
plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing.
The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved

An End-to-End Joint Unsupervised Learning of Deep Model and Pseudo-Classes for Remote Sensing Scene Representation,"Zhiqiang Gong, Ping Zhong, Weidong Hu, Fang Liu, Bingwei Hui","This work develops a novel end-to-end deep unsupervised learning method based
on convolutional neural network (CNN) with pseudo-classes for remote sensing
scene representation. First, we introduce center points as the centers of the
pseudo classes and the training samples can be allocated with pseudo labels
based on the center points. Therefore, the CNN model, which is used to extract
features from the scenes, can be trained supervised with the pseudo labels.
Moreover, a pseudo-center loss is developed to decrease the variance between
the samples and the corresponding pseudo center point. The pseudo-center loss
is important since it can update both the center points with the training
samples and the CNN model with the center points in the training process
simultaneously. Finally, joint learning of the pseudo-center loss and the
pseudo softmax loss which is formulated with the samples and the pseudo labels
is developed for unsupervised remote sensing scene representation to obtain
discriminative representations from the scenes. Experiments are conducted over
two commonly used remote sensing scene datasets to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method and the experimental results show the superiority of the
proposed method when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Counterpoint by Convolution,"Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Tim Cooijmans, Adam Roberts, Aaron Courville, Douglas Eck","Machine learning models of music typically break up the task of composition
into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from
beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear
fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously
made. In order to better approximate this process, we train a convolutional
neural network to complete partial musical scores, and explore the use of
blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to rewriting. Neither the model nor the
generative procedure are tied to a particular causal direction of composition.
Our model is an instance of orderless NADE (Uria et al., 2014), which allows
more direct ancestral sampling. However, we find that Gibbs sampling greatly
improves sample quality, which we demonstrate to be due to some conditional
distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap

A Nonlinear Observer for Free-Floating Target Motion using only Pose Measurements,"Hrishik Mishra, Marco De Stefano, Alessandro Massimo Giordano, Christian Ott","In this paper, we design a nonlinear observer to estimate the inertial pose
and the velocity of a free-floating non-cooperative satellite (Target) using
only relative pose measurements. In the context of control design for orbital
robotic capture of such a non-cooperative Target, due to lack of navigational
aids, only a relative pose estimate may be obtained from slow-sampled and noisy
exteroceptive sensors. The velocity, however, cannot be measured directly. To
address this problem, we develop a model-based observer which acts as an
internal model for Target kinematics/dynamics and therefore, may act as a
predictor during periods of no measurement. To this end, firstly, we formalize
the estimation problem on the SE(3) Lie group with different state and
measurement spaces. Secondly, we develop the kinematics and dynamics observer

Graph Convolutional Label Noise Cleaner: Train a Plug-and-play Action Classifier for Anomaly Detection,"Jia-Xing Zhong, Nannan Li, Weijie Kong, Shan Liu, Thomas H. Li, Ge Li","Video anomaly detection under weak labels is formulated as a typical

supervised action classifiers to weakly supervised anomaly detection, and take
maximum advantage of these well-developed classifiers. For this purpose, we
devise a graph convolutional network to correct noisy labels. Based upon
feature similarity and temporal consistency, our network propagates supervisory
signals from high-confidence snippets to low-confidence ones. In this manner,
the network is capable of providing cleaned supervision for action classifiers.
During the test phase, we only need to obtain snippet-wise predictions from the

A Network Monitoring Game with Heterogeneous Component Criticality Levels,"Jezdimir Milosevic, Mathieu Dahan, Saurabh Amin, Henrik Sandberg","We consider an attacker-operator game for monitoring a large-scale network

individual sensor locations are mutually disjoint; (ii) When only a single

Our analysis reveals new insights on how criticality levels impact the players

Functional target controllability of networks: structural properties and efficient algorithms,"Christian Commault, Jacob van der Woude, Paolo Frasca","In this paper we consider the problem of controlling a limited number of
target nodes of a network. Equivalently, we can see this problem as controlling
the target variables of a structured system, where the state variables of the
system are associated to the nodes of the network. We deal with this problem
from a different point of view as compared to most recent literature. Indeed,
instead of considering controllability in the Kalman sense, that is, as the
ability to drive the target states to a desired value, we consider the stronger
requirement of driving the target variables as time functions. The latter
notion is called functional target controllability. We think that restricting
the controllability requirement to a limited set of important variables
justifies using a more accurate notion of controllability for these variables.
Remarkably, the notion of functional controllability allows formulating very
simple graphical conditions for target controllability in the spirit of the
structural approach to controllability. The functional approach enables us,
moreover, to determine the smallest set of steering nodes that need to be
actuated to ensure target controllability, where these steering nodes are
constrained to belong to a given set. We show that such a smallest set can be
found in polynomial time. We are also able to classify the possible actuated

complete solution to decision-making in the presence of diverging user
expectations that is amenable to a classical planning compilation while

Prototype-based classifiers in the presence of concept drift: A modelling framework,"Michael Biehl, Fthi Abadi, Christina Göpfert, Barbara Hammer","We present a modelling framework for the investigation of prototype-based
classifiers in non-stationary environments. Specifically, we study Learning
Vector Quantization (LVQ) systems trained from a stream of high-dimensional,
clustered data.We consider standard winner-takes-all updates known as LVQ1.
Statistical properties of the input data change on the time scale defined by
the training process. We apply analytical methods borrowed from statistical
physics which have been used earlier for the exact description of learning in
stationary environments. The suggested framework facilitates the computation of
learning curves in the presence of virtual and real concept drift. Here we
focus on timedependent class bias in the training data. First results
demonstrate that, while basic LVQ algorithms are suitable for the training in
non-stationary environments, weight decay as an explicit mechanism of
forgetting does not improve the performance under the considered drift

POI Semantic Model with a Deep Convolutional Structure,"Ji Zhao, Meiyu Yu, Huan Chen, Boning Li, Lingyu Zhang, Qi Song, Li Ma, Hua Chai, Jieping Ye","When using the electronic map, POI retrieval is the initial and important
step, whose quality directly affects the user experience. Similarity between
user query and POI information is the most critical feature in POI retrieval.
An accurate similarity calculation is challenging since the mismatch between a
query and a retrieval text may exist in the case of a mistyped query or an
alias inquiry. In this paper, we propose a POI latent semantic model based on
deep networks, which can effectively extract query features and POI information
features for the similarity calculation. Our model describes the semantic
information of complex texts at multiple layers, and achieves multi-field
matches by modeling POI's name and detailed address respectively. Our model is
evaluated by the POI retrieval ranking datasets, including the labeled data of

Generating Adversarial Examples With Conditional Generative Adversarial Net,"Ping Yu, Kaitao Song, Jianfeng Lu","Recently, deep neural networks have significant progress and successful
application in various fields, but they are found vulnerable to attack
instances, e.g., adversarial examples. State-of-art attack methods can generate
attack images by adding small perturbation to the source image. These attack
images can fool the classifier but have little impact to human. Therefore, such
attack instances are difficult to generate by searching the feature space. How
to design an effective and robust generating method has become a spotlight.
Inspired by adversarial examples, we propose two novel generative models to
produce adaptive attack instances directly, in which conditional generative
adversarial network is adopted and distinctive strategy is designed for
training. Compared with the common method, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method,
our models can reduce the generating cost and improve robustness and has about

Effects of padding on LSTMs and CNNs,"Mahidhar Dwarampudi, N V Subba Reddy","Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) have become very common and are used in many fields as they were
effective in solving many problems where the general neural networks were

sequences. Since LSTMs and CNNs take inputs of the same length and dimension,
input images and sequences are padded to maximum length while testing and
training. This padding can affect the way the networks function and can make a
great deal when it comes to performance and accuracies. This paper studies this
and suggests the best way to pad an input sequence. This paper uses a simple

Interlaced: Fully decentralized churn stabilization for Skip Graph-based DHTs,"Yahya Hassanzadeh-Nazarabadi, Alptekin Küpçü, Öznur Özkasap","As a distributed hash table (DHT) routing overlay, Skip Graph is used in a
variety of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems including cloud storage, social networks,
and search engines. The overlay connectivity of P2P systems is negatively
affected by the arrivals and departures of nodes to and from the system that is
known as churn. Preserving connectivity of the overlay network (i.e., the
reachability of every pair of nodes) under churn is a performance challenge in
every P2P system including the Skip Graph-based ones. The existing
decentralized churn stabilization solutions that are applicable on Skip Graphs
have intensive communication complexities, which leave them unable to provide a
strong overlay connectivity, especially under high rates of churn.
In this paper, we propose Interlaced, a fully decentralized churn
stabilization mechanism for Skip Graphs that provides drastically stronger
overlay connectivity without changing the asymptotic complexity of the Skip
Graph in terms of storage, computation, and communication. We also propose the
Sliding Window De Bruijn Graph (SW-DBG) as a tool to predict the availability
of nodes with high accuracy. Our simulation results show that in comparison to
the best existing DHT-based solutions, Interlaced improves the overlay
connectivity of Skip Graph under churn with the gain of about 1.81 times. A
Skip Graph that benefits from Interlaced and SW-DBG is about 2.47 times faster
on average in routing the queries under churn compared to the best existing
solutions. We also present an adaptive extension of Interlaced to be applied on
other DHTs, for example Kademlia.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
An Output Feedback Stabilizer for MIMO Nonlinear Systems with Uncertain Input Gain: Nonlinear Nominal Model,"Wonseok Ha, Juhoon Back","This paper deals with the output feedback stabilization problem of nonlinear
multi-input multi-output systems having an uncertain input gain matrix. It is
assumed that the system has a well-defined vector relative degree and that the
zero dynamics is input-to-state stable. Based on the assumption that there
exists a state feedback controller which globally asymptotically stabilizes the
origin of the nominal closed-loop system, we present an output feedback
stabilizer which recovers the stability of the nominal closed-loop system in
the semi-global practical sense. Compared to previous results, we allow that
the nominal system can have a nonlinear input gain matrix that is a function of
state and this is done by modifying the structure of the disturbance
observer-based robust output feedback controller. It is expected that the
proposed controller can be well applied to the case when the system's

Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization,"Taesung Park, Ming-Yu Liu, Ting-Chun Wang, Jun-Yan Zhu","We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for
synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous
methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which
is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and
nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization
layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we
propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization
layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on
several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method
over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with

Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network,"Xiao Wang, Houye Ji, Chuan Shi, Bai Wang, Peng Cui, P. Yu, Yanfang Ye","Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on
deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable
research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural
network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and
links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges
for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of
the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism,
whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this
paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the
hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions.
Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a
node and its metapath based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is
able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned
importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of
node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can
generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors
in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world
heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed
model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good
interpretability for graph analysis.",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation Using Dilated-Convolutions,"Zhaokang Chen, Bertram E. Shi","Appearance-based gaze estimation has attracted more and more attention
because of its wide range of applications. The use of deep convolutional neural
networks has improved the accuracy significantly. In order to improve the
estimation accuracy further, we focus on extracting better features from eye
images. Relatively large changes in gaze angles may result in relatively small
changes in eye appearance. We argue that current architectures for gaze
estimation may not be able to capture such small changes, as they apply
multiple pooling layers or other downsampling layers so that the spatial
resolution of the high-level layers is reduced significantly. To evaluate
whether the use of features extracted at high resolution can benefit gaze
estimation, we adopt dilated-convolutions to extract high-level features
without reducing spatial resolution. In cross-subject experiments on the
Columbia Gaze dataset for eye contact detection and the MPIIGaze dataset for 3D
gaze vector regression, the resulting Dilated-Nets achieve significant (up to
20.8%) gains when compared to similar networks without dilated-convolutions.

hierarchical structures are ubiquitous in those fields and there is a general
interest to learning hyperbolic representations or embeddings of such tasks.
Additionally, these embeddings of related tasks may also share a low-rank
subspace. In this work, we propose to learn hyperbolic embeddings such that
they also lie in a low-dimensional subspace. In particular, we consider the

Bilateral Cyclic Constraint and Adaptive Regularization for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Prediction,"Alex Wong, Byung-Woo Hong, Stefano Soatto","Supervised learning methods to infer (hypothesize) depth of a scene from a
single image require costly per-pixel ground-truth. We follow a geometric
approach that exploits abundant stereo imagery to learn a model to hypothesize
scene structure without direct supervision. Although we train a network with
stereo pairs, we only require a single image at test time to hypothesize
disparity or depth. We propose a novel objective function that exploits the
bilateral cyclic relationship between the left and right disparities and we
introduce an adaptive regularization scheme that allows the network to handle
both the co-visible and occluded regions in a stereo pair. This process
ultimately produces a model to generate hypotheses for the 3-dimensional
structure of the scene as viewed in a single image. When used to generate a
single (most probable) estimate of depth, our method outperforms

Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Rician Fading and Phase Shifts,"Özgecan Özdogan, Emil Björnson, Jiayi Zhang","In this paper, we study the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) spectral efficiency
(SE) of a cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with
Rician fading channels. The phase of the line-of-sight (LoS) path is modeled as
a uniformly distributed random variable to take the phase-shifts due to
mobility and phase noise into account. Considering the availability of prior
information at the access points (APs), the phase-aware minimum mean square
error (MMSE), non-aware linear MMSE (LMMSE), and least-square (LS) estimators
are derived. The MMSE estimator requires perfectly estimated phase knowledge
whereas the LMMSE and LS are derived without it.
In the UL, a two-layer decoding method is investigated in order to mitigate
both coherent and non-coherent interference. Closed-form UL SE expressions with
phase-aware MMSE, LMMSE, and LS estimators are derived for maximum-ratio (MR)
combining in the first layer and optimal large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) in
the second layer. In the DL, two different transmission modes are studied:
coherent and non-coherent. Closed-form DL SE expressions for both transmission
modes with MR precoding are derived for the three estimators. Numerical results
show that the LSFD improves the UL SE performance and coherent transmission
mode performs much better than non-coherent transmission in the DL. Besides,
the performance loss due to the lack of phase information depends on the pilot
length and it is small when the pilot contamination is low.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,"[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 1 Nov 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Grid-Connected Power Converters,"Linbin Huang, Jeremy Coulson, John Lygeros, Florian Dorfler","We apply a novel data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm in
grid-connected power converters to perform safe and optimal control. Rather
than a model, the DeePC algorithm solely needs input/output data measured from
the unknown system to predict future trajectories. We show that the DeePC can
eliminate undesired oscillations in a grid-connected power converter and
stabilize an unstable system. However, the DeePC algorithm may suffer from poor
scalability when applied in high-order systems. To this end, we present a
finite-horizon output-based model predictive control (MPC) for grid-connected

and numerically compare their closed-loop performance. Moreover, the PEM-MPC is

Secure distributed filtering for unstable dynamics under compromised observations,"Xingkang He, Xiaoqiang Ren, Henrik Sandberg, Karl Henrik Johansson","In this paper, we consider a secure distributed filtering problem for linear

recursive distributed filter consisting of two parts at each time. The first
part employs a saturation-like scheme, which gives a small gain if the
innovation is too large. The second part is a consensus operation of state
estimates among neighboring agents. A sufficient condition is then established
for the boundedness of estimation error, which is with respect to network
topology, system structure, and the maximal compromised agent subset. We
further provide an equivalent statement, which connects to 2s-sparse

Network Weight Estimation for Binary-Valued Observation Models,"Yu Xing, Xingkang He, Haitao Fang, Karl Henrik Johansson","This paper studies the estimation of network weights for a class of systems

are available for the network estimation. Furthermore, system states are
coupled with observations, and the quantization parts are unknown inherent

estimation, we propose a recursive algorithm based on stochastic approximation
techniques. More precisely, to deal with the temporal dependency of
observations and achieve the recursive estimation of network weights, a
deterministic objective function is constructed based on the likelihood
function by extending the dimension of observations and applying ergodic
properties of Markov chains. It is shown that this function is strictly concave
and has unique maximum identical to the true parameter vector. Finally, the
strong consistency of the algorithm is established. Our recursive algorithm can

Joint axis estimation for fast and slow movements using weighted gyroscope and acceleration constraints,"Fredrik Olsson, Thomas Seel, Dustin Lehmann, Kjartan Halvorsen","Sensor-to-segment calibration is a crucial step in inertial motion tracking.
When two segments are connected by a hinge joint, for example in human knee and
finger joints as well as in many robotic limbs, then the joint axis vector must
be identified in the intrinsic sensor coordinate systems. There exist methods
that identify these coordinates by solving an optimization problem that is
based on kinematic joint constraints, which involve either the measured
accelerations or the measured angular rates. In the current paper we
demonstrate that using only one of these constraints leads to inaccurate
estimates at either fast or slow motions. We propose a novel method based on a
cost function that combines both constraints. The restrictive assumption of a
homogeneous magnetic field is avoided by using only accelerometer and gyroscope
readings. To combine the advantages of both sensor types, the residual weights
are adjusted automatically based on the estimated signal variances and a
nonlinear weighting of the acceleration norm difference. The method is
evaluated using real data from nine different motions of an upper limb
exoskeleton. Results show that, unlike previous approaches, the proposed method

Securely Trading Unverifiable Information without Trust,"Yuqing Kong, Yiping Ma, Yifan Wu","In future, information may become one of the most important assets in
economy. However, unlike common goods (e.g. clothing), information is
troublesome in trading since the information commodities are \emph{vulnerable},
as they lose their values immediately after revelation, and possibly
unverifiable, as they can be subjective. By authorizing a trusted center (e.g.
Amazon) to help manage the information trade, traders are ``forced'' to give
the trusted center the ability to become an information monopolist.
To this end, we need a trust-free (i.e. without a trusted center and with
only strategic traders) unverifiable information trade protocol such that it 1)
motivates the sellers to provide high quality information, and the buyer to pay
for the information with a fair price (truthful); 2) except the owner, the
information is known only to its buyer if the trade is executed (secure).
In an unverifiable information trade scenario (e.g. a medical company wants
to buy experts' opinions on multiple difficult medical images with unknown
pathological truth from several hospitals), we design a trust-free, truthful,
and secure protocol, Smart Info-Dealer (SMind), for information trading, by
borrowing three cutting-edge tools that include peer prediction, secure
multi-party computation, and smart contract. With SMind, without a trusted
center, a seller with high-quality information is able to sell her information
securely at a fair price and those with low-quality information cannot earn
extra money with poor information or steal information from other sellers. We
believe SMind will help describe a free and secure information trade scenario

Social Identity in Software Development,"Andreas Bäckevik, Erik Tholén, Lucas Gren","An agile approach has become very popular over the last decade, which

on the effectiveness of software development through seven in-dept interviews.
The qualitative data from interviews were analyzed and summarized using
summative content analysis, and the seven individuals also answered a

Learning Hierarchical Discourse-level Structure for Fake News Detection,"Hamid Karimi, Jiliang Tang","On the one hand, nowadays, fake news articles are easily propagated through
various online media platforms and have become a grand threat to the
trustworthiness of information. On the other hand, our understanding of the
language of fake news is still minimal. Incorporating hierarchical
discourse-level structure of fake and real news articles is one crucial step
toward a better understanding of how these articles are structured.
Nevertheless, this has rarely been investigated in the fake news detection
domain and faces tremendous challenges. First, existing methods for capturing
discourse-level structure rely on annotated corpora which are not available for
fake news datasets. Second, how to extract out useful information from such
discovered structures is another challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Discourse-level Structure for Fake news detection. HDSF
learns and constructs a discourse-level structure for fake/real news articles
in an automated and data-driven manner. Moreover, we identify insightful
structure-related properties, which can explain the discovered structures and
boost our understating of fake news. Conducted experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. Further structural analysis suggests
that real and fake news present substantial differences in the hierarchical
discourse-level structures.",Computation and Language (cs.CL),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 27 Feb 2019 (v1), last revised 10 Apr 2019 (this version, v6)]"
Probabilistic Energy Forecasting using Quantile Regressions based on a new Nearest Neighbors Quantile Filter,"Jorge Ángel González Ordiano (1), Lutz Gröll (1), Ralf Mikut (1), Veit Hagenmeyer (1) ((1) Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)","Parametric quantile regressions are a useful tool for creating probabilistic
energy forecasts. Nonetheless, since classical quantile regressions are trained

obtain quantile regressions independently of the utilized data mining technique

limited data resources. One less-explored application of GANs is the synthesis

Scheduled Intrinsic Drive: A Hierarchical Take on Intrinsically Motivated Exploration,"Jingwei Zhang, Niklas Wetzel, Nicolai Dorka, Joschka Boedecker, Wolfram Burgard","Exploration in sparse reward reinforcement learning remains an open
challenge. Many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic motivation to complement
the sparse extrinsic reward signal, giving the agent more opportunities to
receive feedback during exploration. Commonly these signals are added as bonus
rewards, which results in a mixture policy that neither conducts exploration
nor task fulfillment resolutely. In this paper, we instead learn separate
intrinsic and extrinsic task policies and schedule between these different
drives to accelerate exploration and stabilize learning. Moreover, we introduce
a new type of intrinsic reward denoted as successor feature control (SFC),
which is general and not task-specific. It takes into account statistics over
complete trajectories and thus differs from previous methods that only use
local information to evaluate intrinsic motivation. We evaluate our proposed
scheduled intrinsic drive (SID) agent using three different environments with

Automatic Classification of Pathology Reports using TF-IDF Features,"Shivam Kalra, Larry Li, Hamid R. Tizhoosh","A Pathology report is arguably one of the most important documents in
medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the
patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to
20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode
high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and
tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable
information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to
facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate
automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis
(based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by
extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using
three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed
a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories,
collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and
testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting
them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently
pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by
OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using
XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\%
accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for
highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for
the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in

A Lightweight Optical Flow CNN - Revisiting Data Fidelity and Regularization,"Tak-Wai Hui, Xiaoou Tang, Chen Change Loy","Over four decades, the majority addresses the problem of optical flow
estimation using variational methods. With the advance of machine learning,
some recent works have attempted to address the problem using convolutional
neural network (CNN) and have showed promising results. FlowNet2, the
state-of-the-art CNN, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow
estimation. Our LiteFlowNet2 outperforms FlowNet2 on Sintel and KITTI
benchmarks, while being 25.3 times smaller in the model size and 3.1 times
faster in the running speed. LiteFlowNet2 is built on the foundation laid by
conventional methods and resembles the corresponding roles as data fidelity and
regularization in variational methods. We compute optical flow in a
spatial-pyramid formulation as SPyNet but through a novel lightweight cascaded
flow inference. It provides high flow estimation accuracy through early
correction with seamless incorporation of descriptor matching. Flow
regularization is used to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow
boundaries through feature-driven local convolutions. Our network also owns an
effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature
warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2 and SPyNet.
Comparing to LiteFlowNet, LiteFlowNet2 improves the optical flow accuracy on

Complexity-entropy analysis at different levels of organization in written language,"E. Estevez-Rams, A. Mesa Rodriguez, D. Estevez-Moya","Written language is complex. A written text can be considered an attempt to

context dependence and highly redundant in its use of resources. Despite all
these constraints, unpredictability is an essential element of natural
language. Here we present the use of entropic measures to assert the balance
between predictability and surprise in written text. In short, it is possible
to measure innovation and context preservation in a document. It is shown that
this can also be done at the different levels of organization of a text. The

The Norms of Graph Spanners,"Eden Chlamtáč, Michael Dinitz, Thomas Robinson","A $t$-spanner of a graph $G$ is a subgraph $H$ in which all distances are
preserved up to a multiplicative $t$ factor. A classical result of Althöfer
et al. is that for every integer $k$ and every graph $G$, there is a
$(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$ with at most $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. But for some
settings the more interesting notion is not the number of edges, but the
degrees of the nodes. This spurred interest in and study of spanners with small
maximum degree. However, this is not necessarily a robust enough objective: we
would like spanners that not only have small maximum degree, but also have
""few"" nodes of ""large"" degree. To interpolate between these two extremes, in
this paper we initiate the study of graph spanners with respect to the
$\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector, thus simultaneously modeling the number
of edges (the $\ell_1$-norm) and the maximum degree (the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm).
We give precise upper bounds for all ranges of $p$ and stretch $t$: we prove
that the greedy $(2k-1)$-spanner has $\ell_p$ norm of at most $\max(O(n),
O(n^{(k+p)/(kp)}))$, and that this bound is tight (assuming the Erdős girth
conjecture). We also study universal lower bounds, allowing us to give
""generic"" guarantees on the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm which
generalize and interpolate between the known approximations for the $\ell_1$
and $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Finally, we show that at least in some situations,
the $\ell_p$ norm behaves fundamentally differently from $\ell_1$ or
$\ell_{\infty}$: there are regimes ($p=2$ and stretch $3$ in particular) where
the greedy spanner has a provably superior approximation to the generic
guarantee.",Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Communication-Efficient Federated Deep Learning with Asynchronous Model Update and Temporally Weighted Aggregation,"Yang Chen, Xiaoyan Sun, Yaochu Jin","Federated learning obtains a central model on the server by aggregating
models trained locally on clients. As a result, federated learning does not
require clients to upload their data to the server, thereby preserving the data
privacy of the clients. One challenge in federated learning is to reduce the
client-server communication since the end devices typically have very limited
communication bandwidth. This paper presents an enhanced federated learning
technique by proposing a synchronous learning strategy on the clients and a
temporally weighted aggregation of the local models on the server. In the
asynchronous learning strategy, different layers of the deep neural networks
are categorized into shallow and deeps layers and the parameters of the deep
layers are updated less frequently than those of the shallow layers.
Furthermore, a temporally weighted aggregation strategy is introduced on the
server to make use of the previously trained local models, thereby enhancing
the accuracy and convergence of the central model. The proposed algorithm is
empirically on two datasets with different deep neural networks. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous federated deep learning outperforms

Scene Segmentation-Based Luminance Adjustment for Multi-Exposure Image Fusion,"Yuma Kinoshita, Hitoshi Kiya","We propose a novel method for adjusting luminance for multi-exposure image
fusion. For the adjustment, two novel scene segmentation approaches based on
luminance distribution are also proposed. Multi-exposure image fusion is a
method for producing images that are expected to be more informative and
perceptually appealing than any of the input ones, by directly fusing photos
taken with different exposures. However, existing fusion methods often produce
unclear fused images when input images do not have a sufficient number of
different exposure levels. In this paper, we point out that adjusting the
luminance of input images makes it possible to improve the quality of the final
fused images. This insight is the basis of the proposed method. The proposed
method enables us to produce high-quality images, even when undesirable inputs
are given. Visual comparison results show that the proposed method can produce
images that clearly represent a whole scene. In addition, multi-exposure image
fusion with the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in

systematic, uses off-the-shelf maximum distance separable (MDS) codes and
maximum rank distance (MRD) Gabidulin block codes as constituent codes and
achieves the optimal error correction. It presents a natural generalization to

this remarkable feat. Some have conjectured it depends on heuristics that do
not truly take hierarchical structure into account. We present here a detailed
study of the inner mechanics of number tracking in LSTMs at the single neuron
level. We discover that long-distance number information is largely managed by
two `number units'. Importantly, the behaviour of these units is partially
controlled by other units independently shown to track syntactic structure. We
conclude that LSTMs are, to some extent, implementing genuinely syntactic

MUSEFood: Multi-sensor-based Food Volume Estimation on Smartphones,"Junyi Gao, Weihao Tan, Liantao Ma, Yasha Wang, Wen Tang","Researches have shown that diet recording can help people increase awareness
of food intake and improve nutrition management, and thereby maintain a
healthier life. Recently, researchers have been working on smartphone-based
diet recording methods and applications that help users accomplish two tasks:
record what they eat and how much they eat. Although the former task has made
great progress through adopting image recognition technology, it is still a
challenge to estimate the volume of foods accurately and conveniently. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, named MUSEFood, for food volume estimation.
MUSEFood uses the camera to capture photos of the food, but unlike existing
volume measurement methods, MUSEFood requires neither training images with
volume information nor placing a reference object of known size while taking
photos. In addition, considering the impact of different containers on the
contour shape of foods, MUSEFood uses a multi-task learning framework to
improve the accuracy of food segmentation, and uses a differential model
applicable for various containers to further reduce the negative impact of
container differences on volume estimation accuracy. Furthermore, MUSEFood uses
the microphone and the speaker to accurately measure the vertical distance from
the camera to the food in a noisy environment, thus scaling the size of food in
the image to its actual size. The experiments on real foods indicate that
MUSEFood outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, and highly improves the speed

constitutes one possible tool to this end. It introduces an additional
component, a default or prior behavior, which can be learned alongside the
policy and as such partially transforms the reinforcement learning problem into
one of behavior modelling. In this work we consider the implications of this
framework in cases where both the policy and default behavior are augmented
with latent variables. We discuss how the resulting hierarchical structures can
be used to implement different inductive biases and how their modularity can

One-Way Topological Automata and the Tantalizing Effects of Their Topological Features,Tomoyuki Yamakami,"We cast new light on the existing models of one-way deterministic topological
automata by introducing a fresh but general, convenient model, in which, as
each input symbol is read, an interior system of an automaton, known as a
configuration, continues to evolve in a topological space by applying
continuous transition operators one by one. The acceptance and rejection of a
given input are determined by observing the interior system after the input is
completely processed. Such automata naturally generalize one-way finite
automata of various types, including deterministic, probabilistic, quantum, and
pushdown automata. We examine the strengths and weaknesses of the power of this
new automata model when recognizing formal languages. We investigate
tantalizing effects of various topological features of our topological automata
by analyzing their behaviors when different kinds of topological spaces and
continuous maps, which are used respectively as configuration spaces and

"Solving $x^{2^k+1}+x+a=0$ in $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ with $\gcd(n,k)=1$","Kwang Ho Kim, Sihem Mesnager","Let $N_a$ be the number of solutions to the equation $x^{2^k+1}+x+a=0$ in
$\GF {n}$ where $\gcd(k,n)=1$. In 2004, by Bluher \cite{BLUHER2004} it was
known that possible values of $N_a$ are only 0, 1 and 3. In 2008, Helleseth and
Kholosha \cite{HELLESETH2008} have got criteria for $N_a=1$ and an explicit
expression of the unique solution when $\gcd(k,n)=1$. In 2014, Bracken, Tan and
Tan \cite{BRACKEN2014} presented a criterion for $N_a=0$ when $n$ is even and
$\gcd(k,n)=1$.
This paper completely solves this equation $x^{2^k+1}+x+a=0$ with only
condition $\gcd(n,k)=1$. We explicitly calculate all possible zeros in $\GF{n}$

Dissecting the NVidia Turing T4 GPU via Microbenchmarking,"Zhe Jia, Marco Maggioni, Jeffrey Smith, Daniele Paolo Scarpazza","In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs,
coupled with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still
a hurdle for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible
performance. Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta
GPU architecture using microbenchmarks.
The introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia's latest architecture,
pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine Turing and compare
it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations. Specifically, we
study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications. We
describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the P4
GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts.
We study the performance of the T4's TensorCores, finding a much higher
throughput on low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing
introduces new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map
Turing's instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional
instructions. We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory
hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are
frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each
constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance
improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects
compute-intensive workloads that hit power or thermal limits.
Many of our findings are novel, published here for the first time. All of
them can guide high-performance software developers get closer to the GPU's
peak performance.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]

Bilinear Representation for Language-based Image Editing Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Xiaofeng Mao, Yuefeng Chen, Yuhong Li, Tao Xiong, Yuan He, Hui Xue","The task of Language-Based Image Editing (LBIE) aims at generating a target
image by editing the source image based on the given language description. The
main challenge of LBIE is to disentangle the semantics in image and text and
then combine them to generate realistic images. Therefore, the editing
performance is heavily dependent on the learned representation. In this work,
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is utilized for LBIE. We find
that existing conditioning methods in cGAN lack of representation power as they
cannot learn the second-order correlation between two conditioning vectors. To
solve this problem, we propose an improved conditional layer named Bilinear
Residual Layer (BRL) to learning more powerful representations for LBIE task.

generate images with higher quality when compared to previous LBIE techniques.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Understanding the Limitations of CNN-based Absolute Camera Pose Regression,"Torsten Sattler, Qunjie Zhou, Marc Pollefeys, Laura Leal-Taixe","Visual localization is the task of accurate camera pose estimation in a known
scene. It is a key problem in computer vision and robotics, with applications
including self-driving cars, Structure-from-Motion, SLAM, and Mixed Reality.
Traditionally, the localization problem has been tackled using 3D geometry.
Recently, end-to-end approaches based on convolutional neural networks have
become popular. These methods learn to directly regress the camera pose from an
input image. However, they do not achieve the same level of pose accuracy as 3D
structure-based methods. To understand this behavior, we develop a theoretical
model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for
pose regression techniques and verify our predictions through experiments. We
furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related
to pose approximation via image retrieval than to accurate pose estimation via
3D structure. A key result is that current approaches do not consistently
outperform a handcrafted image retrieval baseline. This clearly shows that
additional research is needed before pose regression algorithms are ready to
compete with structure-based methods.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
An Effective Label Noise Model for DNN Text Classification,"Ishan Jindal, Daniel Pressel, Brian Lester, Matthew Nokleby","Because large, human-annotated datasets suffer from labeling errors, it is
crucial to be able to train deep neural networks in the presence of label
noise. While training image classification models with label noise have
received much attention, training text classification models have not. In this
paper, we propose an approach to training deep networks that is robust to label
noise. This approach introduces a non-linear processing layer (noise model)
that models the statistics of the label noise into a convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture. The noise model and the CNN weights are learned
jointly from noisy training data, which prevents the model from overfitting to
erroneous labels. Through extensive experiments on several text classification
datasets, we show that this approach enables the CNN to learn better sentence
representations and is robust even to extreme label noise. We find that proper
initialization and regularization of this noise model is critical. Further, by
contrast to results focusing on large batch sizes for mitigating label noise
for image classification, we find that altering the batch size does not have
much effect on classification performance.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Computation and Language (cs.CL); Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Forecasting the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease Using Neural Networks and a Novel Pre-Processing Algorithm,Jack Albright,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in
older people. Despite considerable efforts to find a cure for AD, there is a
99.6% failure rate of clinical trials for AD drugs, likely because AD patients
cannot easily be identified at early stages. This project investigated machine
learning approaches to predict the clinical state of patients in future years
to benefit AD research. Clinical data from 1737 patients was obtained from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and was processed
using the ""All-Pairs"" technique, a novel methodology created for this project
involving the comparison of all possible pairs of temporal data points for each
patient. This data was then used to train various machine learning models.
Models were evaluated using 7-fold cross-validation on the training dataset and
confirmed using data from a separate testing dataset (110 patients). A neural
network model was effective (mAUC = 0.866) at predicting the progression of AD
on a month-by-month basis, both in patients who were initially cognitively
normal and in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment. Such a model
could be used to identify patients at early stages of AD and who are therefore
good candidates for clinical trials for AD therapeutics.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 22 Mar 2019 (this version, v2)]"

Extrapolating paths with graph neural networks,"Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier, Andreas Loukas","We consider the problem of path inference: given a path prefix, i.e., a
partially observed sequence of nodes in a graph, we want to predict which nodes

as a by-product of the interaction of an agent with a network---a driver on the
transportation network, an information seeker in Wikipedia, or a client in an
online shop. Our interest is sparked by the realization that, in contrast to
shortest-path problems, natural paths are usually not optimal in any
graph-theoretic sense, but might still follow predictable patterns.
Our main contribution is a graph neural network called Gretel. Conditioned on
a path prefix, this network can efficiently extrapolate path suffixes, evaluate
path likelihood, and sample from the future path distribution. Our experiments

EV-IMO: Motion Segmentation Dataset and Learning Pipeline for Event Cameras,"Anton Mitrokhin, Chengxi Ye, Cornelia Fermuller, Yiannis Aloimonos, Tobi Delbruck","We present the first event-based learning approach for motion segmentation in
indoor scenes and the first event-based dataset - EV-IMO - which includes
accurate pixel-wise motion masks, egomotion and ground truth depth. Our
approach is based on an efficient implementation of the SfM learning pipeline
using a low parameter neural network architecture on event data. In addition to
camera egomotion and a dense depth map, the network estimates pixel-wise
independently moving object segmentation and computes per-object 3D
translational velocities for moving objects. We also train a shallow network
with just 40k parameters, which is able to compute depth and egomotion.
Our EV-IMO dataset features 32 minutes of indoor recording with up to 3 fast
moving objects simultaneously in the camera field of view. The objects and the
camera are tracked by the VICON motion capture system. By 3D scanning the room
and the objects, accurate depth map ground truth and pixel-wise object masks
are obtained, which are reliable even in poor lighting conditions and during
fast motion. We then train and evaluate our learning pipeline on EV-IMO and

Efficient and Extensible Policy Mining for Relationship-Based Access Control,"Thang Bui, Scott D. Stoller, Hieu Le","Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) is a flexible and expressive
framework that allows policies to be expressed in terms of chains of
relationship between entities as well as attributes of entities. ReBAC policy
mining algorithms have a potential to significantly reduce the cost of
migration from legacy access control systems to ReBAC, by partially automating
the development of a ReBAC policy. Existing ReBAC policy mining algorithms
support a policy language with a limited set of operators; this limits their
applicability. This paper presents a ReBAC policy mining algorithm designed to
be both (1) easily extensible (to support additional policy language features)
and (2) scalable. The algorithm is based on Bui et al.'s evolutionary algorithm
for ReBAC policy mining algorithm. First, we simplify their algorithm, in order
to make it easier to extend and provide a methodology that extends it to handle
new policy language features. However, extending the policy language increases
the search space of candidate policies explored by the evolutionary algorithm,
thus causes longer running time and/or worse results. To address the problem,
we enhance the algorithm with a feature selection phase. The enhancement
utilizes a neural network to identify useful features. We use the result of
feature selection to reduce the evolutionary algorithm's search space. The new
algorithm is easy to extend and, as shown by our experiments, is more efficient

LYRICS: a General Interface Layer to Integrate Logic Inference and Deep Learning,"Giuseppe Marra, Francesco Giannini, Michelangelo Diligenti, Marco Gori","In spite of the amazing results obtained by deep learning in many
applications, a real intelligent behavior of an agent acting in a complex

Therefore, there is a clear need for the definition of a general and tight

effectively elaborated using deep learning techniques, and the logic reasoning
that allows humans to take decisions in complex environments. This paper
presents LYRICS, a generic interface layer for AI, which is implemented in

arbitrary First Order Logic (FOL) background knowledge. The predicates and
functions of the FOL knowledge can be bound to any TF computational graph, and
the formulas are converted into a set of real-valued constraints, which
participate to the overall optimization problem. This allows to learn the
weights of the learners, under the constraints imposed by the prior knowledge.
The framework is extremely general as it imposes no restrictions in terms of
which models or knowledge can be integrated. In this paper, we show the

Visual Cue Integration for Small Target Motion Detection in Natural Cluttered Backgrounds,"Hongxin Wang, Jigen Peng, Qinbing Fu, Huatian Wang, Shigang Yue","The robust detection of small targets against cluttered background is
important for future artificial visual systems in searching and tracking
applications. The insects' visual systems have demonstrated excellent ability
to avoid predators, find prey or identify conspecifics - which always appear as
small dim speckles in the visual field. Build a computational model of the
insects' visual pathways could provide effective solutions to detect small
moving targets. Although a few visual system models have been proposed, they
only make use of small-field visual features for motion detection and their
detection results often contain a number of false positives. To address this
issue, we develop a new visual system model for small target motion detection
against cluttered moving backgrounds. Compared to the existing models, the
small-field and wide-field visual features are separately extracted by two
motion-sensitive neurons to detect small target motion and background motion.
These two types of motion information are further integrated to filter out

Should Citations be Counted Separately from Each Originating Section,Mike Thelwall,"Articles are cited for different purposes and differentiating between reasons

universal solution, this article compares 19 million citations with DOIs from
six different standard sections in 799,055 PubMed Central open access articles

between fields in the most citing sections and the extent to which citations
from one section overlap with citations from another, with some degree of

partly unreliable indicators of citation context, even if they are more

MediaRank: Computational Ranking of Online News Sources,"Junting Ye, Steven Skiena","In the recent political climate, the topic of news quality has drawn

Morphing Contact Representations of Graphs,"Patrizio Angelini, Steven Chaplick, Sabine Cornelsen, Giordano Da Lozzo, Vincenzo Roselli","We consider the problem of morphing between contact representations of a
plane graph. In an $\mathcal F$-contact representation of a plane graph $G$,
vertices are realized by internally disjoint elements from a family $\mathcal
F$ of connected geometric objects. Two such elements touch if and only if their
corresponding vertices are adjacent. These touchings also induce the same
embedding as in $G$. In a morph between two $\mathcal F$-contact
representations we insist that at each time step (continuously throughout the
morph) we have an $\mathcal F$-contact representation.
We focus on the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of triangles in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ that are the lower-right half of axis-parallel rectangles. Such
RT-representations exist for every plane graph and right triangles are one of
the simplest families of shapes supporting this property. Thus, they provide a
natural case to study regarding morphs of contact representations of plane
graphs.
We study piecewise linear morphs, where each step is a linear morph moving
the endpoints of each triangle at constant speed along straight-line
trajectories. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether there
is a piecewise linear morph between two RT-representations of an $n$-vertex
plane triangulation, and, if so, computes a morph with $\mathcal O(n^2)$ linear
morphs. As a direct consequence, we obtain that for $4$-connected plane
triangulations there is a morph between every pair of RT-representations where
the ``top-most'' triangle in both representations corresponds to the same
vertex. This shows that the realization space of such RT-representations of any
$4$-connected plane triangulation forms a connected set.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),; Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
On the Capacity of Computation Broadcast,"Hua Sun, Syed A. Jafar","The two-user computation broadcast problem is introduced as the setting where
User $1$ wants message $W_1$ and has side-information $W_1'$, User $2$ wants
message $W_2$ and has side-information $W_2'$, and $(W_1, W_1', W_2, W_2')$ may
have arbitrary dependencies. The rate of a computation broadcast scheme is
defined as the ratio $H(W_1,W_2)/H(S)$, where $S$ is the information broadcast
to both users to simultaneously satisfy their demands. The supremum of
achievable rates is called the capacity of computation broadcast $C_{CB}$. It
is shown that $C_{CB}\leq
H(W_1,W_2)/\left[H(W_1|W_1')+H(W_2|W_2')-\min\Big(I(W_1; W_2, W_2'|W_1'),
I(W_2; W_1, W_1'|W_2')\Big)\right]$. For the linear computation broadcast
problem, where $W_1, W_1', W_2, W_2'$ are comprised of arbitrary linear
combinations of a basis set of independent symbols, the bound is shown to be
tight. For non-linear computation broadcast, it is shown that this bound is not
tight in general. Examples are provided to prove that different instances of
computation broadcast that have the same entropic structure, i.e., the same
entropy for all subsets of $\{W_1,W_1',W_2,W_2'\}$, can have different
capacities. Thus, extra-entropic structure matters even for two-user
computation broadcast. The significance of extra-entropic structure is further
explored through a class of non-linear computation broadcast problems where the
extremal values of capacity are shown to correspond to minimally and maximally
structured problems within that class.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Security and Privacy on Blockchain,"Rui Zhang, Rui Xue, Ling Liu","Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing
transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open
environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for
cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed
cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the
Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing
interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and
privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when
deploying blockchain in different applications. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate
the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in
the context of Bitcoin like online transactions. Then we describe the basic
security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and
building blocks for Bitcoin like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting
the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many
blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques
for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including
representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols,
anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We

Multi-Differential Fairness Auditor for Black Box Classifiers,"Xavier Gitiaux, Huzefa Rangwala","Machine learning algorithms are increasingly involved in sensitive
decision-making process with adversarial implications on individuals. This
paper presents mdfa, an approach that identifies the characteristics of the
victims of a classifier's discrimination. We measure discrimination as a

guarantee that a black box classifier's outcomes do not leak information on the
sensitive attributes of a small group of individuals. We reduce the problem of
identifying worst-case violations to matching distributions and predicting
where sensitive attributes and classifier's outcomes coincide. We apply mdfa to

"HexaShrink, an exact scalable framework for hexahedral meshes with attributes and discontinuities: multiresolution rendering and storage of geoscience models","Jean-Luc Peyrot, Laurent Duval, Frédéric Payan, Lauriane Bouard, Lénaïc Chizat, Sébastien Schneider, Marc Antonini","With huge data acquisition progresses realized in the past decades and
acquisition systems now able to produce high resolution grids and point clouds,
the digitization of physical terrains becomes increasingly more precise. Such
extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational
performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media,
memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity,
necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and
storage are thus becoming ""enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and
simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for
structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in
biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides
a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage.
Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of
meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous
or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes
compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different
multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global
framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a
fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are
provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the
consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization,

A constructive proof of dependent choice in classical arithmetic via memoization,Étienne Miquey,"In a recent paper, Herbelin developed dPA${^\omega}$, a calculus in which
constructive proofs for the axioms of countable and dependent choices could be
derived via the memoization of choice functions. However, the property of
normalization (and therefore the one of soundness) was only conjectured. The
difficulty for the proof of normalization is due to the simultaneous presence
of dependent types (for the constructive part of the choice), of control
operators (for classical logic), of coinductive objects (to encode functions of
type ${\mathbb{N} \to A}$ into streams (${a_0},{a_1},...$)) and of lazy
evaluation with sharing (for memoizing these coinductive objects). Elaborating
on previous works, we introduce in this paper a variant of dPA${^\omega}$
presented as a sequent calculus. On the one hand, we take advantage of a
variant of Krivine classical realizability that we developed to prove the
normalization of classical call-by-need. On the other hand, we benefit from
dL${_{\hat{tp}}}$, a classical sequent calculus with dependent types in which
type safety is ensured by using delimited continuations together with a
syntactic restriction. By combining the techniques developed in these papers,
we manage to define a realizability interpretation à la Krivine of our
calculus that allows us to prove normalization and soundness. This paper goes
over the whole process, starting from Herbelin's calculus dPA${^\omega}$ until
our introduction of its sequent calculus counterpart dLPA${^\omega}$.",Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
A Method for Reducing the Complexity of Model Predictive Control in Robotics Applications,"Michael Muehlebach, Raffaello D'Andrea","This article describes an approach for parametrizing input and state
trajectories in model predictive control. The parametrization is designed to be
invariant to time shifts, which enables warm-starting the successive
optimization problems and reduces the computational complexity of the online
optimization. It is shown that in certain cases (e.g. for linear time-invariant
dynamics with input and state constraints) the parametrization leads to
inherent stability and recursive feasibility guarantees without additional
terminal set constraints. Due to the fact that the number of decision variables
are greatly reduced through the parametrization, while the warm-starting

Feasibility of Serving K Secondary Users in Underlay Cognitive Radio Networks using Massive MIMO,"Shailesh Chaudhari, Danijela Cabric","In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of serving K secondary users (SUs)
on the downlink using a secondary base station (SBS), equipped with a large
antenna array, in an underlay cognitive radio (CR) network. First, we formulate
a feasibility problem in order to compute beamforming vectors and power
allocations for K SUs with constraints on the maximum allowable interference to
primary users (PUs), required minimum rate at SUs, and maximum transmit power
from SBS. The problem formulation takes into account the imperfect channel
state information between SUs and PUs. We propose a two step approach to solve
the non-convex problem. In the first step, beamforming vectors are computed
using one of the two alternative schemes: maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB)
or zero forcing beamforming (ZFB). We show that the power allocations can be
computed by solving a linear programming feasibility problem. Further, we
provide theoretical feasibility analysis of serving K SUs with equal power
allocation by deriving the distributions of SINR at SUs and interference to
PUs, thereby computing the probability of serving K SUs as a function of the
constraints. The analytical and simulation results are presented to demonstrate
the impact of constraints on the feasibility of serving K SUs in the CR

Downlink transceiver beamforming and admission control for massive MIMO cognitive radio networks,"Shailesh Chaudhari, Danijela Cabric","In this paper, an optimization framework is proposed for joint transceiver

objective of the optimization problem is to support maximum number of secondary

channels between the secondary and the primary nodes and also mitigates the
interference caused by the primary users at secondary receivers. In order to
solve the underlying NP-hard problem, we propose a three-step algorithm with
two alternative schemes for power allocation, namely: equal power and equal

Recommending Comprehensive Solutions for Programming Tasks by Mining Crowd Knowledge,"Rodrigo F. G. Silva, Chanchal K. Roy, Mohammad Masudur Rahman, Kevin A. Schneider, Klerisson Paixao, Marcelo de Almeida Maia","Developers often search for relevant code examples on the web for their
programming tasks. Unfortunately, they face two major problems. First, the
search is impaired due to a lexical gap between their query (task description)
and the information associated with the solution. Second, the retrieved
solution may not be comprehensive, i.e., the code segment might miss a succinct
explanation. These problems make the developers browse dozens of documents in
order to synthesize an appropriate solution. To address these two problems, we
propose CROKAGE (Crowd Knowledge Answer Generator), a tool that takes the
description of a programming task (the query) and provides a comprehensive
solution for the task. Our solutions contain not only relevant code examples
but also their succinct explanations. Our proposed approach expands the task
description with relevant API classes from Stack Overflow Q&A threads and then
mitigates the lexical gap problems. Furthermore, we perform natural language
processing on the top quality answers and then return such programming
solutions containing code examples and code explanations unlike earlier
studies. We evaluate our approach using 48 programming queries and show that it
outperforms six baselines including the state-of-art by a statistically
significant margin. Furthermore, our evaluation with 29 developers using 24

SCNN: A General Distribution based Statistical Convolutional Neural Network with Application to Video Object Detection,"Tianchen Wang, Jinjun Xiong, Xiaowei Xu, Yiyu Shi","Various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed recently that
achieved accuracy comparable with that of human beings in computer vision tasks
such as image recognition, object detection and tracking, etc. Most of these
networks, however, process one single frame of image at a time, and may not
fully utilize the temporal and contextual correlation typically present in
multiple channels of the same image or adjacent frames from a video, thus
limiting the achievable throughput. This limitation stems from the fact that
existing CNNs operate on deterministic numbers. In this paper, we propose a
novel statistical convolutional neural network (SCNN), which extends existing
CNN architectures but operates directly on correlated distributions rather than
deterministic numbers. By introducing a parameterized canonical model to model
correlated data and defining corresponding operations as required for CNN
training and inference, we show that SCNN can process multiple frames of
correlated images effectively, hence achieving significant speedup over
existing CNN models. We use a CNN based video object detection as an example to
illustrate the usefulness of the proposed SCNN as a general network model.
Experimental results show that even a non-optimized implementation of SCNN can
still achieve 178% speedup over existing CNNs with slight accuracy degradation.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 15 Mar 2019]

with so-far grounded phrase-region pairs. These LSTM stacks collectively
capture context for grounding of the next phrase. The resulting architecture,
which we call SeqGROUND, supports many-to-many matching by allowing an image
region to be matched to multiple phrases and vice versa. We show competitive

Software-defined Design Space Exploration for an Efficient DNN Accelerator Architecture,"Ye Yu, Yingmin Li, Shuai Che, Niraj K. Jha, Weifeng Zhang","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to outperform conventional
machine learning algorithms across a wide range of applications, e.g., image
recognition, object detection, robotics, and natural language processing.
However, the high computational complexity of DNNs often necessitates extremely
fast and efficient hardware. The problem gets worse as the size of neural
networks grows exponentially. As a result, customized hardware accelerators
have been developed to accelerate DNN processing without sacrificing model
accuracy. However, previous accelerator design studies have not fully
considered the characteristics of the target applications, which may lead to
sub-optimal architecture designs. On the other hand, new DNN models have been
developed for better accuracy, but their compatibility with the underlying
hardware accelerator is often overlooked. In this article, we propose an
application-driven framework for architectural design space exploration of DNN
accelerators. This framework is based on a hardware analytical model of
individual DNN operations. It models the accelerator design task as a
multi-dimensional optimization problem. We demonstrate that it can be
efficaciously used in application-driven accelerator architecture design. Given
a target DNN, the framework can generate efficient accelerator design solutions
with optimized performance and area. Furthermore, we explore the opportunity to
use the framework for accelerator configuration optimization under simultaneous
diverse DNN applications. The framework is also capable of improving neural

Benchmarking Web API Quality -- Revisited,"David Bermbach, Erik Wittern","Modern applications increasingly interact with web APIs -- reusable

Reachability-Based Safety Guarantees using Efficient Initializations,"Sylvia L. Herbert, Shromona Ghosh, Somil Bansal, Claire J. Tomlin","Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for
analyzing the safety of autonomous systems. This analysis is computationally
intensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomous
system may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/or
the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather than
restarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of ""warm-start""
reachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically the
previously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closer
to the solution than the standard initialization, convergence may take fewer
iterations.
In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteed
conservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided to
maintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problem
formulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions.We demonstrate our
method on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also on a
more practical example with a 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes in
mass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly. We

Are All Successful Communities Alike? Characterizing and Predicting the Success of Online Communities,"Tiago Cunha, David Jurgens, Chenhao Tan, Daniel Romero","The proliferation of online communities has created exciting opportunities to
study the mechanisms that explain group success. While a growing body of
research investigates community success through a single measure -- typically,
the number of members -- we argue that there are multiple ways of measuring
success. Here, we present a systematic study to understand the relations
between these success definitions and test how well they can be predicted based
on community properties and behaviors from the earliest period of a community's
lifetime. We identify four success measures that are desirable for most
communities: (i) growth in the number of members; (ii) retention of members;
(iii) long term survival of the community; and (iv) volume of activities within
the community. Surprisingly, we find that our measures do not exhibit very high
correlations, suggesting that they capture different types of success.
Additionally, we find that different success measures are predicted by
different attributes of online communities, suggesting that success can be
achieved through different behaviors. Our work sheds light on the basic
understanding of what success represents in online communities and what
predicts it. Our results suggest that success is multi-faceted and cannot be
measured nor predicted by a single measurement. This insight has practical

urgent to develop good prediction models for human-operated vehicles. This is
fundamentally a challenging task as humans are often noisy in their decision
processes. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a useful tool in control theory
that provides safety guarantees for collision avoidance. In this paper, we
first demonstrate how to incorporate information derived from HJ reachability
into a machine learning problem which predicts human behavior in a simulated
collision avoidance context, and show that this yields a higher prediction
accuracy than learning without this information. Then we propose a framework to
generate stochastic forward reachable sets that flexibly provides different
safety probabilities and generalizes to novel scenarios. We demonstrate that we
can construct stochastic reachable sets that can capture the trajectories with
probability from 0.75 to 1.",Systems and Control (eess.SY),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Learning to Augment Synthetic Images for Sim2Real Policy Transfer,"Alexander Pashevich, Robin Strudel, Igor Kalevatykh, Ivan Laptev, Cordelia Schmid","Vision and learning have made significant progress that could improve
robotics policies for complex tasks and environments. Learning deep neural
networks for image understanding, however, requires large amounts of
domain-specific visual data. While collecting such data from real robots is
possible, such an approach limits the scalability as learning policies
typically requires thousands of trials. In this work we attempt to learn
manipulation policies in simulated environments. Simulators enable scalability
and provide access to the underlying world state during training. Policies
learned in simulators, however, do not transfer well to real scenes given the
domain gap between real and synthetic data. We follow recent work on domain
randomization and augment synthetic images with sequences of random
transformations. Our main contribution is to optimize the augmentation strategy
for sim2real transfer and to enable domain-independent policy learning. We
design an efficient search for depth image augmentations using object
localization as a proxy task. Given the resulting sequence of random
transformations, we use it to augment synthetic depth images during policy
learning. Our augmentation strategy is policy-independent and enables policy
learning with no real images. We demonstrate our approach to significantly
improve accuracy on three manipulation tasks evaluated on a real robot.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 30 Jul 2019 (this version, v2)]"
The epidemiology of lateral movement: exposures and countermeasures with network contagion models,Brian A. Powell,"An approach is developed for analyzing computer networks to identify systems
and accounts that are at particular risk of compromise by an adversary seeking
to move laterally through the network via authentication. The dynamics of the
adversary are modeled as a contagion spreading across systems linked via
authentication relationships derived from Administrator account access and
active session data. The adversary is assumed to traverse the network via
credential chaining, where the adversary steals credentials from one system,
uses them to authenticate to another, and repeats the process. Graph topology
measures are used to analyze different contagion models applied to a real
Windows network for three primary exposures by identifying: accounts which,
either individually or collectively, provide wide and far-reaching access to
many systems across the network; accounts with notable privilege escalation
liability; and ""gatekeeper"" systems through which the adversary must pass in
order to reach critical assets. The approach can be used to test how different
mitigations and countermeasures affect these exposures; for example, we find
that disabling remote logins by local accounts and implementing protections
that prevent the caching of credentials on remote hosts can substantially
curtail lateral movement and privilege escalation.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Real-Time Constrained Trajectory Planning and Vehicle Control for Proactive Autonomous Driving With Road Users,"Ivo Batkovic, Mario Zanon, Mohammad Ali, Paolo Falcone","For motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles to be proactive and

predicted motion into constraints for the MPC problem.
Simulations and experimental validation were performed with simulated
crossing pedestrians to show the performance of the framework. Experimental
results show that the controller is stable even under significant input delays,

Distributed Subtrajectory Join on Massive Datasets,"Panagiotis Tampakis, Christos Doulkeridis, Nikos Pelekis, Yannis Theodoridis","Joining trajectory datasets is a significant operation in mobility data
analytics and the cornerstone of various methods that aim to extract knowledge
out of them. In the era of Big Data, the production of mobility data has become
massive and, consequently, performing such an operation in a centralized way is
not feasible. In this paper, we address the problem of Distributed
Subtrajectory Join processing by utilizing the MapReduce programming model.
Compared to traditional trajectory join queries, this problem is even more
challenging since the goal is to retrieve all the ""maximal"" portions of
trajectories that are ""similar"". We propose three solutions: (i) a
well-designed basic solution, coined DTJb, (ii) a solution that uses a
preprocessing step that repartitions the data, labeled DTJr, and (iii) a
solution that, additionally, employs an indexing scheme, named DTJi. In our
experimental study, we utilize a 56GB dataset of real trajectories from the
maritime domain, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest real
dataset used for experimentation in the literature of trajectory data
management. The results show that DTJi performs up to 16x faster compared with
DTJb, 10x faster than DTJr and 3x faster than the closest related state of the

A New Frontier for Pull-Based Graph Processing,"Samuel Grossman, Christos Kozyrakis","The trade-off between pull-based and push-based graph processing engines is
well-understood. On one hand, pull-based engines can achieve higher throughput
because their workloads are read-dominant, rather than write-dominant, and can
proceed without synchronization between threads. On the other hand, push-based
engines are much better able to take advantage of the frontier optimization,
which leverages the fact that often only a small subset of the graph needs to
be accessed to complete an iteration of a graph processing application. Hybrid
engines attempt to overcome this trade-off by dynamically switching between
push and pull, but there are two key disadvantages with this approach. First,
applications must be implemented twice (once for push and once for pull), and
second, processing throughput is reduced for iterations that run with push.
We propose a radically different solution: rebuild the frontier optimization
entirely such that it is well-suited for a pull-based engine. In doing so, we
remove the only advantage that a push-based engine had over a pull-based
engine, making it possible to eliminate the push-based engine entirely. We
introduce Wedge, a pull-only graph processing framework that transforms the
traditional source-oriented vertex-based frontier into a pull-friendly format
called the Wedge Frontier. The transformation itself is expensive even when
parallelized, so we introduce two key optimizations to make it practical.
First, we perform the transformation only when the resulting Wedge Frontier is
sufficiently sparse. Second, we coarsen the granularity of the representation
of elements in the Wedge Frontier. These optimizations respectively improve
Wedge's performance by up to 5x and 2x, enabling it to outperform Grazelle,
Ligra, and GraphMat respectively by up to 2.8x, 4.9x, and 185.5x.","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)",,[Submitted on 18 Mar 2019]
Hierarchical Routing Mixture of Experts,"Wenbo Zhao, Yang Gao, Shahan Ali Memon, Bhiksha Raj, Rita Singh","In regression tasks the distribution of the data is often too complex to be
fitted by a single model. In contrast, partition-based models are developed
where data is divided and fitted by local models. These models partition the
input space and do not leverage the input-output dependency of
multimodal-distributed data, and strong local models are needed to make good
predictions. Addressing these problems, we propose a binary tree-structured
hierarchical routing mixture of experts (HRME) model that has classifiers as
non-leaf node experts and simple regression models as leaf node experts. The
classifier nodes jointly soft-partition the input-output space based on the
natural separateness of multimodal data. This enables simple leaf experts to be
effective for prediction. Further, we develop a probabilistic framework for the
HRME model, and propose a recursive Expectation-Maximization (EM) based
algorithm to learn both the tree structure and the expert models. Experiments

Distance Distribution Between Two Random Nodes in Arbitrary Polygons,"Ross Pure, Salman Durrani, Fei Tong, Jianping Pan","Distance distributions are a key building block in stochastic geometry

(convex or concave) polygon regions (which may be disjoint or overlap or
coincide). The proposed framework is based on measure theory and uses polar

form results. We validate our proposed framework by comparison with simulations
and published closed form results in the literature for simple cases. We
illustrate the versatility and advantage of the proposed framework by deriving
closed form results for a case not yet reported in the literature. Finally, we

A Parallel Data Compression Framework for Large Scale 3D Scientific Data,"Panagiotis Hadjidoukas, Fabian Wermelinger","Large scale simulations of complex systems ranging from climate and
astrophysics to crowd dynamics, produce routinely petabytes of data and are
projected to reach the zettabytes level in the coming decade. These simulations

by the enormous data sizes associated with the computational elements and
respective output quantities of interest that impose severe constraints on
storage and I/O time. In this work, we address these challenges through a novel
software framework for scientific data compression. The software (CubismZ)
incorporates efficient wavelet based techniques and the state-of-the-art ZFP,
SZ and FPZIP floating point compressors. The framework relies on a
block-structured data layout, benefits from OpenMP and MPI and targets
supercomputers based on multicores. CubismZ can be used as a tool for ex situ
(offline) compression of scientific datasets and supports conventional
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) file formats. Moreover, it provides a
testbed of comparison, in terms of compression factor and peak signal-to-noise
ratio, for a number of available data compression methods. The software yields

Deep Reinforcement Learning with Decorrelation,"Borislav Mavrin, Hengshuai Yao, Linglong Kong","Learning an effective representation for high-dimensional data is a
challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) such as Deep Q networks (DQN) achieves remarkable success in computer
games by learning deeply encoded representation from convolution networks. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet very effective method for representation
learning with DRL algorithms. Our key insight is that features learned by DRL
algorithms are highly correlated, which interferes with learning. By adding a
regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only
slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural
networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor,
our decorrelation algorithms perform $70\%$ in terms of human-normalized
scores, which is $40\%$ better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better
than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on $6$ games.
Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile
Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further

Variational B-rep Model Analysis for Direct Modeling using Geometric Perturbation,"Qiang Zou, Hsi-Yung Feng","The very recent CAD paradigm of direct modeling gives rise to the need of
processing 3D geometric constraint systems defined on boundary representation

the STEP format) is that free motions of a well-constrained model involve more
than just rigid-body motions. The fundamental difficulty lies in having a
systematic description of what pattern these free motions follow. This paper
proposes a geometric perturbation method to study these free motions. This
method is a generalization of the witness method, allowing it to directly deal
with variational B-rep models represented with the standard STEP scheme. This
generalization is essentially achieved by using a direct, geometric
representation of the free motions, and then expressing the free motions in

A Comparative Study of Different Approaches for Tracking Communities in Evolving Social Networks,"Ziwei He, Etienne Gael Tajeuna, Shengrui Wang, Mohamed Bouguessa","In real-world social networks, there is an increasing interest in tracking
the evolution of groups of users and detecting the various changes they are
liable to undergo. Several approaches have been proposed for this. In studying
these approaches, we observed that most of them use a two-stage process. In the
first stage, they run an algorithm to identify groups of users at each
timestamp. In the second stage, a pair-wise comparison based on a similarity
measure is employed to track groups of users and detect changes they may
undergo. While the majority of existing approaches use a two-stage process,
they all run different algorithms to identify communities and rely on different
similarity measures to track groups of users over time. Noting that the
different approaches may perform differently depending on the dynamic social
network under investigation, we decided to make a high level survey of some
existing tracking approaches and then do a comparative analysis of some of
them. In our analysis, we compared the algorithms in two main situations: $(1)$

Energy-Aware Digital Signatures for Embedded Medical Devices,"Muslum Ozgur Ozmen, Attila A. Yavuz, Rouzbeh Behnia","Authentication is vital for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications
involving sensitive data (e.g., medical and financial systems). Digital
signatures offer scalable authentication with non-repudiation and public
verifiability, which are necessary for auditing and dispute resolution in such
IoT applications. However, digital signatures have been shown to be highly
costly for low-end IoT devices, especially when embedded devices (e.g., medical
implants) must operate without a battery replacement for a long time.
We propose an Energy-aware Signature for Embedded Medical devices (ESEM) that
achieves near-optimal signer efficiency. ESEM signature generation does not
require any costly operations (e.g., elliptic curve (EC) scalar
multiplication/addition), but only a small constant-number of pseudo-random
function calls, additions, and a single modular multiplication. ESEM has the
smallest signature size among its EC-based counterparts with an identical
private key size. We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral
public key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a
distributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer
while permitting a constant-size public key. We proved that ESEM is secure (in
random oracle model), and fully implemented it on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller
that is commonly used in medical devices. Our experiments showed that ESEM
achieves 8.4x higher energy efficiency over its closest counterpart while
offering a smaller signature and code size. Hence, ESEM can be suitable for
deployment on resource limited embedded devices in IoT. We open-sourced our

because of interactions and spatial correlations between different regions. In
addition, it is affected by many factors: i) multiple temporal correlations
among different time intervals: closeness, period, trend; ii) complex external
influential factors: weather, events; iii) meta features: time of the day, day
of the week, and so on. In this paper, we formulate crowd flow forecasting in
irregular regions as a spatio-temporal graph (STG) prediction problem in which
each node represents a region with time-varying flows. By extending graph
convolution to handle the spatial information, we propose using spatial graph
convolution to build a multi-view graph convolutional network (MVGCN) for the

Differentially Private Consensus-Based Distributed Optimization,"Mehrdad Showkatbakhsh, Can Karakus, Suhas Diggavi","Data privacy is an important concern in learning, when datasets contain

nodes take a linear combination of their neighbors' messages, as well as taking
a new gradient step. Since the algorithm requires exchanging messages that
depend on local data, private information gets leaked at every step. Taking
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy (DP) as our criterion, we consider
the strategy where the nodes add random noise to their messages before
broadcasting it, and show that the method achieves convergence with a bounded
mean-squared error, while satisfying $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP. By relaxing the

Umbrella: Enabling ISPs to Offer Readily Deployable and Privacy-Preserving DDoS Prevention Services,"Zhuotao Liu, Yuan Cao, Min Zhu, Wei Ge","Defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the
Internet is a fundamental problem. However, recent industrial interviews with
over 100 security experts from more than ten industry segments indicate that
DDoS problems have not been fully addressed. The reasons are twofold. On one
hand, many academic proposals that are provably secure witness little
real-world deployment. On the other hand, the operation model for existing
DDoS-prevention service providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) is privacy
invasive for large organizations (e.g., government). In this paper, we present
Umbrella, a new DDoS defense mechanism enabling Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) to offer readily deployable and privacy-preserving DDoS prevention
services to their customers. At its core, Umbrella develops a multi-layered
defense architecture to defend against a wide spectrum of DDoS attacks. In
particular, the flood throttling layer stops amplification-based DDoS attacks;
the congestion resolving layer, aiming to prevent sophisticated attacks that
cannot be easily filtered, enforces congestion accountability to ensure that
legitimate flows are guaranteed to receive their fair shares regardless of
attackers' strategies; and finally the userspecific layer allows DDoS victims
to enforce self-desired traffic control policies that best satisfy their
business requirements. Based on Linux implementation, we demonstrate that
Umbrella is capable to deal with large scale attacks involving millions of
attack flows, meanwhile imposing negligible packet processing overhead.
Further, our physical testbed experiments and large scale simulations prove
that Umbrella is effective to mitigate various DDoS attacks.",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),,"[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 6 Apr 2019 (this version, v3)]"
A Truthful Cardinal Mechanism for One-Sided Matching,"Rediet Abebe, Richard Cole, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Jason D. Hartline","We revisit the well-studied problem of designing mechanisms for one-sided
matching markets, where a set of $n$ agents needs to be matched to a set of $n$
heterogeneous items. Each agent $i$ has a value $v_{i,j}$ for each item $j$,
and these values are private information that the agents may misreport if doing
so leads to a preferred outcome. Ensuring that the agents have no incentive to
misreport requires a careful design of the matching mechanism, and mechanisms
proposed in the literature mitigate this issue by eliciting only the
\emph{ordinal} preferences of the agents, i.e., their ranking of the items from
most to least preferred. However, the efficiency guarantees of these mechanisms
are based only on weak measures that are oblivious to the underlying values. In
this paper we achieve stronger performance guarantees by introducing a
mechanism that truthfully elicits the full \emph{cardinal} preferences of the
agents, i.e., all of the $v_{i,j}$ values. We evaluate the performance of this
mechanism using the much more demanding Nash bargaining solution as a
benchmark, and we prove that our mechanism significantly outperforms all
ordinal mechanisms (even non-truthful ones). To prove our approximation bounds,
we also study the population monotonicity of the Nash bargaining solution in
the context of matching markets, providing both upper and lower bounds which

Random Pairwise Shapelets Forest,"Mohan Shi, Zhihai Wang, Jodong Yuan, Haiyang Liu","Shapelet is a discriminative subsequence of time series. An advanced

Robust Visual Tracking Using Dynamic Classifier Selection with Sparse Representation of Label Noise,"Yuefeng Chen, Qing Wang","Recently a category of tracking methods based on ""tracking-by-detection"" is

Dynamic Deep Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation,"Aashis Khanal, Rolando Estrada","Segmenting the retinal vasculature entails a trade-off between how much of
the overall vascular structure we identify vs. how precisely we segment
individual vessels. In particular, state-of-the-art methods tend to
under-segment faint vessels, as well as pixels that lie on the edges of thicker
vessels. Thus, they underestimate the width of individual vessels, as well as
the ratio of large to small vessels. More generally, many crucial
bio-markers---including the artery-vein (AV) ratio, branching angles, number of
bifurcation, fractal dimension, tortuosity, vascular length-to-diameter ratio
and wall-to-lumen length---require precise measurements of individual vessels.
To address this limitation, we propose a novel, stochastic training scheme for
deep neural networks that better classifies the faint, ambiguous regions of the
image. Our approach relies on two key innovations. First, we train our deep
networks with dynamic weights that fluctuate during each training iteration.
This stochastic approach forces the network to learn a mapping that robustly
balances precision and recall. Second, we decouple the segmentation process
into two steps. In the first half of our pipeline, we estimate the likelihood

Self-Weighted Multiview Metric Learning by Maximizing the Cross Correlations,"Huibing Wang, Jinjia Peng, Xianping Fu","With the development of multimedia time, one sample can always be described
from multiple views which contain compatible and complementary information.
Most algorithms cannot take information from multiple views into considerations
and fail to achieve desirable performance in most situations. For many
applications, such as image retrieval, face recognition, etc., an appropriate
distance metric can better reflect the similarities between various samples.
Therefore, how to construct a good distance metric learning methods which can
deal with multiview data has been an important topic during the last decade. In
this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm named Self-weighted Multiview Metric
Learning (SM2L) which can finish this task by maximizing the cross correlations
between different views. Furthermore, because multiple views have different
contributions to the learning procedure of SM2L, we adopt a self-weighted
learning framework to assign multiple views with different weights. Various

Trick or TReAT: Thematic Reinforcement for Artistic Typography,"Purva Tendulkar, Kalpesh Krishna, Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju, Devi Parikh","An approach to make text visually appealing and memorable is semantic
reinforcement - the use of visual cues alluding to the context or theme in
which the word is being used to reinforce the message (e.g., Google Doodles).
We present a computational approach for semantic reinforcement called TReAT -
Thematic Reinforcement for Artistic Typography. Given an input word (e.g. exam)
and a theme (e.g. education), the individual letters of the input word are
replaced by cliparts relevant to the theme which visually resemble the letters
- adding creative context to the potentially boring input word. We use an
unsupervised approach to learn a latent space to represent letters and cliparts
and compute similarities between the two. Human studies show that participants
can reliably recognize the word as well as the theme in our outputs (TReATs)

Safe Policy Synthesis in Multi-Agent POMDPs via Discrete-Time Barrier Functions,"Mohamadreza Ahmadi, Andrew Singletary, Joel W. Burdick, Aaron D. Ames","A multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MPOMDP) is a
modeling paradigm used for high-level planning of heterogeneous autonomous
agents subject to uncertainty and partial observation. Despite their modeling
efficiency, MPOMDPs have not received significant attention in safety-critical

MPOMDPs that ensure safety. Notably, our method does not rely on discretization
of the belief space, or finite memory. To this end, we formulate sufficient and
necessary conditions for the safety of a given set based on discrete-time

for Boolean compositions of DTBFs for representing more complicated safe sets.
We show that the proposed method can be implemented online by a sequence of

Diversity-Promoting Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Recommendation,"Yong Liu, Yinan Zhang, Qiong Wu, Chunyan Miao, Lizhen Cui, Binqiang Zhao, Yin Zhao, Lu Guan","Interactive recommendation that models the explicit interactions between

Low-Rank Discriminative Least Squares Regression for Image Classification,"Zhe Chen, Xiao-Jun Wu, Josef Kittler","Latest least squares regression (LSR) methods mainly try to learn slack
regression targets to replace strict zero-one labels. However, the difference
of intra-class targets can also be highlighted when enlarging the distance
between different classes, and roughly persuing relaxed targets may lead to the
problem of overfitting. To solve above problems, we propose a low-rank
discriminative least squares regression model (LRDLSR) for multi-class image
classification. Specifically, LRDLSR class-wisely imposes low-rank constraint
on the intra-class regression targets to encourage its compactness and
similarity. Moreover, LRDLSR introduces an additional regularization term on
the learned targets to avoid the problem of overfitting. These two improvements
are helpful to learn a more discriminative projection for regression and thus
achieving better classification performance. Experimental results over a range

Fisher Discriminative Least Squares Regression for Image Classification,"Zhe Chen, Xiao-Jun Wu, Josef Kittler","Discriminative least squares regression (DLSR) has been shown to achieve
promising performance in multi-class image classification tasks. Its key idea
is to force the regression labels of different classes to move in opposite
directions by means of the proposed the joint use of the $\epsilon$-draggings
technique, yielding discriminative regression model exhibiting wider margins,
and the Fisher criterion. The $\epsilon$-draggings technique ignores an
important problem: its non-negative relaxation matrix is dynamically updated in
optimization, which means the dragging values can also cause the labels from
the same class to be uncorrelated. In order to learn a more powerful
discriminative projection, as well as regression labels, we propose a Fisher
regularized DLSR (FDLSR) framework by constraining the relaxed labels using the
Fisher criterion. On one hand, the Fisher criterion improves the intra-class
compactness of the relaxed labels during relaxation learning. On the other
hand, it is expected further to enhance the inter-class separability of
$\epsilon$-draggings technique. FDLSR for the first time ever attempts to
integrate the Fisher discriminant criterion and $\epsilon$-draggings technique
into one unified model because they are absolutely complementary in learning
discriminative projection. Extensive experiments on various datasets

Non-negative representation based discriminative dictionary learning for face recognition,"Zhe Chen, Xiao-Jun Wu, Josef Kittler","In this paper, we propose a non-negative representation based discriminative
dictionary learning algorithm (NRDL) for multicategory face classification. In
contrast to traditional dictionary learning methods, NRDL investigates the use
of non-negative representation (NR), which contributes to learning
discriminative dictionary atoms. In order to make the learned dictionary more
suitable for classification, NRDL seamlessly incorporates nonnegative
representation constraint, discriminative dictionary learning and linear
classifier training into a unified model. Specifically, NRDL introduces a
positive constraint on representation matrix to find distinct atoms from
heterogeneous training samples, which results in sparse and discriminative
representation. Moreover, a discriminative dictionary encouraging function is
proposed to enhance the uniqueness of class-specific sub-dictionaries.
Meanwhile, an inter-class incoherence constraint and a compact graph based

Class-incremental Learning via Deep Model Consolidation,"Junting Zhang, Jie Zhang, Shalini Ghosh, Dawei Li, Serafettin Tasci, Larry Heck, Heming Zhang, C.-C. Jay Kuo","Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from ""catastrophic forgetting""

How Hard Is Robust Mean Estimation?,"Samuel B. Hopkins, Jerry Li","Robust mean estimation is the problem of estimating the mean $\mu \in

samples, an $\epsilon$-fraction of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a
malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first
polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \emph{dimension-independent} rates of
error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find
$\hat{\mu}$ with $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\| \leq O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. However, error
rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while
dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when
$D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments.
In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence that improving
on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean
estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that
several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time
robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the
small-set expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurer's small-set

there is still a long way to go to obtain a general and systematic approach

direction and present their results obtained during the n2c2 challenge on
cohort selection for clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The first method
is a weakly supervised method using an unlabeled corpus (MIMIC) to build a
silver standard, by producing semi-automatically a small and very precise set
of rules to detect some samples of positive and negative patients. This silver
standard is then used to train a traditional supervised model. The second
method is a terminology-based approach where a medical expert selects the
appropriate concepts, and a procedure is defined to search the terms and check
the structural or temporal constraints. Results: On the n2c2 dataset containing
annotated data about 13 selection criteria on 288 patients, we obtained an
overall F1-measure of 0.8969, which is the third best result out of 45
participant teams, with no statistically significant difference with the
best-ranked team. Discussion: Both approaches obtained very encouraging results
and apply to different types of criteria. The weakly supervised method requires
explicit descriptions of positive and negative examples in some reports. The
terminology-based method is very efficient when medical concepts carry most of
the relevant information. Conclusion: It is unlikely that much more annotated

A Comparative Study for Unsupervised Network Representation Learning,"Megha Khosla, Vinay Setty, Avishek Anand","There has been appreciable progress in unsupervised network representation
learning (UNRL) approaches over graphs recently with flexible random-walk

different approaches under a unifying framework and empirically investigate the
effectiveness of different network representation methods. In particular, we
argue that most of the UNRL approaches either explicitly or implicit model and
exploit context information of a node. Consequently, we propose a framework
that casts a variety of approaches -- random walk based, matrix factorization
and deep learning based -- into a unified context-based optimization function.
We systematically group the methods based on their similarities and
differences. We study the differences among these methods in detail which we
later use to explain their performance differences (on downstream tasks). We
conduct a large-scale empirical study considering 9 popular and recent UNRL
techniques and 11 real-world datasets with varying structural properties and
two common tasks -- node classification and link prediction. We find that there
is no single method that is a clear winner and that the choice of a suitable
method is dictated by certain properties of the embedding methods, task and

NeuralHydrology -- Interpreting LSTMs in Hydrology,"Frederik Kratzert, Mathew Herrnegger, Daniel Klotz, Sepp Hochreiter, Günter Klambauer","Despite the huge success of Long Short-Term Memory networks, their
applications in environmental sciences are scarce. We argue that one reason is
the difficulty to interpret the internals of trained networks. In this study,
we look at the application of LSTMs for rainfall-runoff forecasting, one of the
central tasks in the field of hydrology, in which the river discharge has to be
predicted from meteorological observations. LSTMs are particularly well-suited
for this problem since memory cells can represent dynamic reservoirs and
storages, which are essential components in state-space modelling approaches of
the hydrological system. On basis of two different catchments, one with snow
influence and one without, we demonstrate how the trained model can be analyzed
and interpreted. In the process, we show that the network internally learns to
represent patterns that are consistent with our qualitative understanding of
the hydrological system.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 12 Nov 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Resource Allocation for Loss Tolerant Video Streaming in eMBMS,"Sadaf ul Zuhra, Prasanna Chaporkar, Abhay Karandikar","Bandwidth hungry video content has become the dominant contributor to the
data traffic world over. Cellular networks are constantly evolving to meet the
growing traffic demands. Over the past few years, wireless multicast has been
garnering a lot of attention as a means of efficient resource utilization.
Multicast transmission lets spectral resources to be shared between users
streaming the same content. Even though multicast transmission allows to serve
multiple users on the same resources, in order to serve all these users
successfully, the base station cannot transmit the content at a rate greater
than that decodable by the user with the worst channel conditions. In this
paper, we propose a way to overcome this bottleneck. Video streaming services
can sustain a certain amount of packet loss without any significant degradation
in the quality experienced by the users. We leverage this loss tolerant nature
of video streaming applications to improve the performance of multicast video
services in LTE and 5G. We convert the problem of resource allocation for loss
tolerant multicasting into the problem of stabilizing a queueing system. We
then propose two throughput optimal Maximum Weight (MW) policies that
successfully stabilize the constructed queueing system. However, brute force
implementation of MW policies is mostly NP-hard. To overcome this, we propose a
maximum weight bipartite matching approach that results in a polynomial time
implementation of the proposed policies. We also evaluate the performance of
our policies via extensive simulations.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),,[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]

Packing Disks into Disks with Optimal Worst-Case Density,"Sándor P. Fekete, Phillip Keldenich, Christian Scheffer","We provide a tight result for a fundamental problem arising from packing
disks into a circular container: The critical density of packing disks in a
disk is 0.5. This implies that any set of (not necessarily equal) disks of
total area $\delta\leq 1/2$ can always be packed into a disk of area 1; on the
other hand, for any $\varepsilon>0$ there are sets of disks of area
$1/2+\varepsilon$ that cannot be packed. The proof uses a careful manual
analysis, complemented by a minor automatic part that is based on interval
arithmetic. Beyond the basic mathematical importance, our result is also useful

Improving Video Compression With Deep Visual-Attention Models,"Vitaliy Lyudvichenko, Mikhail Erofeev, Alexander Ploshkin, Dmitriy Vatolin","Recent advances in deep learning have markedly improved the quality of
visual-attention modelling. In this work we apply these advances to video
compression.
We propose a compression method that uses a saliency model to adaptively
compress frame areas in accordance with their predicted saliency. We selected
three state-of-the-art saliency models, adapted them for video compression and
analyzed their results. The analysis includes objective evaluation of the
models as well as objective and subjective evaluation of the compressed videos.
Our method, which is based on the x264 video codec, can produce videos with
the same visual quality as regular x264, but it reduces the bitrate by 25%
according to the objective evaluation and by 17% according to the subjective
one. Also, both the subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that
saliency models can compete with gaze maps for a single observer.

Geometry-constrained Car Recognition Using a 3D Perspective Network,"Rui Zeng, Zongyuan Ge, Simon Denman, Sridha Sridharan, Clinton Fookes","We present a novel learning framework for vehicle recognition from a single
RGB image. Unlike existing methods which only use attention mechanisms to
locate 2D discriminative information, our work learns a novel 3D perspective
feature representation of a vehicle, which is then fused with 2D appearance
feature to predict the category. The framework is composed of a global network
(GN), a 3D perspective network (3DPN), and a fusion network. The GN is used to
locate the region of interest (RoI) and generate the 2D global feature. With
the assistance of the RoI, the 3DPN estimates the 3D bounding box under the
guidance of the proposed vanishing point loss, which provides a perspective
geometry constraint. Then the proposed 3D representation is generated by
eliminating the viewpoint variance of the 3D bounding box using perspective
transformation. Finally, the 3D and 2D feature are fused to predict the
category of the vehicle. We present qualitative and quantitative results on the
vehicle classification and verification tasks in the BoxCars dataset. The
results demonstrate that, by learning such a concise 3D representation, we can
achieve superior performance to methods that only use 2D information while
retain 3D meaningful information without the challenge of requiring a 3D CAD

What the Constant Velocity Model Can Teach Us About Pedestrian Motion Prediction,"Christoph Schöller, Vincent Aravantinos, Florian Lay, Alois Knoll","Pedestrian motion prediction is a fundamental task for autonomous robots and
vehicles to operate safely. In recent years many complex approaches based on
neural networks have been proposed to address this problem. In this work we
show that - surprisingly - a simple Constant Velocity Model can outperform even
state-of-the-art neural models. This indicates that either neural networks are
not able to make use of the additional information they are provided with, or
that this information is not as relevant as commonly believed. Therefore, we
analyze how neural networks process their input and how it impacts their
predictions. Our analysis reveals pitfalls in training neural networks for
pedestrian motion prediction and clarifies false assumptions about the problem
itself. In particular, neural networks implicitly learn environmental priors
that negatively impact their generalization capability, the motion history of
pedestrians is irrelevant and interactions are too complex to predict. Our work
shows how neural networks for pedestrian motion prediction can be thoroughly

Truly Proximal Policy Optimization,"Yuhui Wang, Hao He, Chao Wen, Xiaoyang Tan","Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most successful deep
reinforcement-learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
wide range of challenging tasks. However, its optimization behavior is still
far from being fully understood. In this paper, we show that PPO could neither
strictly restrict the likelihood ratio as it attempts to do nor enforce a
well-defined trust region constraint, which means that it may still suffer from
the risk of performance instability. To address this issue, we present an
enhanced PPO method, named Truly PPO. Two critical improvements are made in our
method: 1) it adopts a new clipping function to support a rollback behavior to
restrict the difference between the new policy and the old one; 2) the
triggering condition for clipping is replaced with a trust region-based one,
such that optimizing the resulted surrogate objective function provides
guaranteed monotonic improvement of the ultimate policy performance. It seems,
by adhering more truly to making the algorithm proximal - confining the policy
within the trust region, the new algorithm improves the original PPO on both
sample efficiency and performance.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 14 Jan 2020 (this version, v2)]"

"No more, no less - A formal model for serverless computing","Maurizio Gabbrielli, Saverio Giallorenzo, Ivan Lanese, Fabrizio Montesi, Marco Peressotti, Stefano Pio Zingaro","Serverless computing, also known as Functions-as-a-Service, is a recent

distribution and scaling with respect to inbound traffic.
While vendors already support a variety of programming languages for

Minimizing Age in Gateway Based Update Systems,"Sandeep Banik, Sanjit K. Kaul, P. B. Sujit","We consider a network of status updating sensors whose updates are collected
and sent to a monitor by a gateway. The monitor desires as fresh as possible
updates from the network of sensors. The gateway may either poll a sensor for
its status update or it may transmit collected sensor updates to the monitor.
We derive the average age at the monitor for such a setting. We observe that
increasing the frequency of transmissions to the monitor has the upside of
resetting sensor age at the monitor to smaller values. However, it increases
the length of time that elapses before a sensor is polled again. This motivates
our investigation of policies that fix the number of sensors s the gateway
polls before transmitting to the monitor.
For any s, we show that when sensor transmission times to the gateway are
independent and identically distributed (iid), for independent but possibly
non-identical transmission times to the monitor, it is optimal to poll a sensor
with the maximum age at the gateway first. Also, under simplifying assumptions,
the optimal value of s increases as the square root of the number of sensors.
For non-identical sensor transmission times, we consider a policy that polls a
sensor such that the resulting average change in age is minimized. We compare
our policy proposals with other policies, over a wide selection of transmission
time distributions.",Information Theory (cs.IT),; Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 17 Jun 2019 (this version, v3)]"

A New Lower Bound for Semigroup Orthogonal Range Searching,Peyman Afshani,"We report the first improvement in the space-time trade-off of lower bounds
for the orthogonal range searching problem in the semigroup model, since
Chazelle's result from 1990. This is one of the very fundamental problems in
range searching with a long history. Previously, Andrew Yao's influential
result had shown that the problem is already non-trivial in one
dimension~\cite{Yao-1Dlb}: using $m$ units of space, the query time $Q(n)$ must
be $\Omega( \alpha(m,n) + \frac{n}{m-n+1})$ where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the
inverse Ackermann's function, a very slowly growing function.
In $d$ dimensions, Bernard Chazelle~\cite{Chazelle.LB.II} proved that the
query time must be $Q(n) = \Omega( (\log_\beta n)^{d-1})$ where $\beta = 2m/n$.
Chazelle's lower bound is known to be tight for when space consumption is
`high' i.e., $m = \Omega(n \log^{d+\varepsilon}n)$. We have two main results.
The first is a lower bound that shows Chazelle's lower bound was not tight for
`low space': we prove that we must have $m (n) = \Omega(n (\log n \log\log
n)^{d-1})$. Our lower bound does not close the gap to the existing data
structures, however, our second result is that our analysis is tight. Thus, we
believe the gap is in fact natural since lower bounds are proven for idempotent
semigroups while the data structures are built for general semigroups and thus
they cannot assume (and use) the properties of an idempotent semigroup. As a
result, we believe to close the gap one must study lower bounds for
non-idempotent semigroups or building data structures for idempotent
semigroups. We develope significantly new ideas for both of our results that
could be useful in pursuing either of these directions.",Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),,[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]

Efficient Smoothing of Dilated Convolutions for Image Segmentation,"Thomas Ziegler, Manuel Fritsche, Lorenz Kuhn, Konstantin Donhauser","Dilated Convolutions have been shown to be highly useful for the task of
image segmentation. By introducing gaps into convolutional filters, they enable

Even though this allows for the inexpensive capturing of features at different
scales, the structure of the dilated convolutional filter leads to a loss of
information. We hypothesise that inexpensive modifications to Dilated
Convolutional Neural Networks, such as additional averaging layers, could
overcome this limitation. In this project we test this hypothesis by evaluating
the effect of these modifications for a state-of-the art image segmentation
system and compare them to existing approaches with the same objective. Our

Parameter Synthesis for Markov Models,"Sebastian Junges, Erika Abraham, Christian Hensel, Nils Jansen, Joost-Pieter Katoen, Tim Quatmann, Matthias Volk","Markov chain analysis is a key technique in reliability engineering. A

Whereas traditional Markov chain analysis evaluates a reliability metric for a

on synthesising parameter values that establish a given reliability or
performance specification $\varphi$. Examples are: what component failure rates
ensure the probability of a system breakdown to be below 0.00000001?, or which
failure rates maximise reliability? This paper presents various analysis

"Independent Range Sampling, Revisited Again","Peyman Afshani, Jeff M. Phillips","We revisit the range sampling problem: the input is a set of points where
each point is associated with a real-valued weight. The goal is to store them
in a structure such that given a query range and an integer $k$, we can extract
$k$ independent random samples from the points inside the query range, where
the probability of sampling a point is proportional to its weight.
This line of work was initiated in 2014 by Hu, Qiao, and Tao and it was later
followed up by Afshani and Wei. The first line of work mostly studied
unweighted but dynamic version of the problem in one dimension whereas the
second result considered the static weighted problem in one dimension as well
as the unweighted problem in 3D for halfspace queries.
We offer three main results and some interesting insights that were missed by
the previous work: We show that it is possible to build efficient data
structures for range sampling queries if we allow the query time to hold in
expectation (the first result), or obtain efficient worst-case query bounds by
allowing the sampling probability to be approximately proportional to the
weight (the second result). The third result is a conditional lower bound that
shows essentially one of the previous two concessions is needed. For instance,
for the 3D range sampling queries, the first two results give efficient data
structures with near-linear space and polylogarithmic query time whereas the
lower bound shows with near-linear space the worst-case query time must be
close to $n^{2/3}$, ignoring polylogarithmic factors. Up to our knowledge, this
is the first such major gap between the expected and worst-case query time of a
range searching problem.",Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),; Computational Geometry (cs.CG),[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]
Spline Based Intrusion Detection in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET),"David A. Schmidt, Mohamad S. Khan, Brian T. Bennett","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a crucial role in the identification
and mitigation for attacks on host systems. Of these systems, vehicular ad hoc
networks (VANETs) are particularly difficult to protect due to the dynamic
nature of their clients and their necessity for constant interaction with their
respective cyber-physical systems. Currently, there is a need for a
VANET-specific IDS that can satisfy these requirements. Spline function-based
IDSs have shown to be effective in traditional network settings. By examining
the various construction of splines and testing their robustness, the viability
for a spline-based IDS can be determined.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),,[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]
IndyLSTMs: Independently Recurrent LSTMs,"Pedro Gonnet, Thomas Deselaers","We introduce Independently Recurrent Long Short-term Memory cells: IndyLSTMs.
These differ from regular LSTM cells in that the recurrent weights are not
modeled as a full matrix, but as a diagonal matrix, i.e.\ the output and state
of each LSTM cell depends on the inputs and its own output/state, as opposed to
the input and the outputs/states of all the cells in the layer. The number of
parameters per IndyLSTM layer, and thus the number of FLOPS per evaluation, is
linear in the number of nodes in the layer, as opposed to quadratic for regular
LSTM layers, resulting in potentially both smaller and faster models. We
evaluate their performance experimentally by training several models on the
popular \iamondb and CASIA online handwriting datasets, as well as on several
of our in-house datasets. We show that IndyLSTMs, despite their smaller size,
consistently outperform regular LSTMs both in terms of accuracy per parameter,
and in best accuracy overall. We attribute this improved performance to the
IndyLSTMs being less prone to overfitting.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]

Multi-party authorization and conflict mediation for decentralized configuration management processes,"Holger Kinkelin, Heiko Niedermayer, Marc Müller, Georg Carle","Configuration management in networks with highest security demands must not
depend on just one administrator and her device. Otherwise, problems can be
caused by mistakes or malicious behavior of this admin, or when her computer
got compromised, which allows an attacker to abuse the administrator's
far-reaching permissions.
Instead, we propose to use a reliable and resilient configuration management
process orchestrated by a configuration management system (CMS). This can be
achieved by separation of concerns (proposing a configuration vs. authorizing
it), employing multi-party authorization (MPA), and enforcing that only
authorized configurations can be deployed. This results in a configuration
management process that is decentralized on a human, decision-making level, and
a technical, device level.
However, due to different opinions or adversarial interference, the result of
an MPA process can end in a conflict. This raises the question how such
conflicts can be mediated in a better way than just employing majority voting,
which is insufficient in certain situations. As an alternative, this paper
introduces building blocks of customizable conflict mediation strategies which
we integrated into our CMS TANCS . The conflict mediation functionality as well
as the initial TANCS implementation run on top of the distributed ledger and

Identity-Free Facial Expression Recognition using conditional Generative Adversarial Network,"Jie Cai, Zibo Meng, Ahmed Shehab Khan, Zhiyuan Li, James O'Reilly, Yan Tong","In this paper, we proposed a novel Identity-free conditional Generative
Adversarial Network (IF-GAN) to explicitly reduce inter-subject variations for
facial expression recognition. Specifically, for any given input face image, a
conditional generative model was developed to transform an average neutral
face, which is calculated from various subjects showing neutral expressions, to
an average expressive face with the same expression as the input image. Since
the transformed images have the same synthetic ""average"" identity, they differ
from each other by only their expressions and thus, can be used for
identity-free expression classification. In this work, an end-to-end system was
developed to perform expression transformation and expression recognition in
the IF-GAN framework. Experimental results on three facial expression datasets

Learning Reciprocity in Complex Sequential Social Dilemmas,"Tom Eccles, Edward Hughes, János Kramár, Steven Wheelwright, Joel Z. Leibo","Reciprocity is an important feature of human social interaction and underpins

Corners for Layout: End-to-End Layout Recovery from 360 Images,"Clara Fernandez-Labrador, Jose M. Facil, Alejandro Perez-Yus, Cédric Demonceaux, Javier Civera, Jose J. Guerrero","The problem of 3D layout recovery in indoor scenes has been a core research
topic for over a decade. However, there are still several major challenges that

state-of-the-art methods make implicit or explicit assumptions on the scenes --
e.g. box-shaped or Manhattan layouts. Also, current methods are computationally

Natural Language Generation at Scale: A Case Study for Open Domain Question Answering,"Alessandra Cervone, Chandra Khatri, Rahul Goel, Behnam Hedayatnia, Anu Venkatesh, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Raefer Gabriel","Current approaches to Natural Language Generation (NLG) for dialog mainly
focus on domain-specific, task-oriented applications (e.g. restaurant booking)

amounts of data for each domain, and do not benefit from examples that may be

statistical NLG to scenarios requiring larger ontologies, such as multi-domain

open-domain QA. First, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of
slot types on the generation quality and experiment with different partitions

Second, we perform multi-task learning experiments between open-domain QA and

Residual Deep Convolutional Neural Network for EEG Signal Classification in Epilepsy,"Diyuan Lu, Jochen Triesch","Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, affecting about 1%
of the population at all ages. As many as 60% of people with epilepsy
experience focal seizures which originate in a certain brain area and are
limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. In focal epilepsy patients, a
precise surgical removal of the seizure onset zone can lead to effective
seizure control or even a seizure-free outcome. Thus, correct identification of
the seizure onset zone is essential. For clinical evaluation purposes,
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly used. However, their
interpretation is usually done manually by physicians and is time-consuming and
error-prone. In this work, we propose an automated epileptic signal
classification method based on modern deep learning methods. In contrast to
previous approaches, the network is trained directly on the EEG recordings,
avoiding hand-crafted feature extraction and selection procedures. This
exploits the ability of deep neural networks to detect and extract relevant
features automatically, that may be too complex or subtle to be noticed by
humans. The proposed network structure is based on a convolutional neural
network with residual connections. We demonstrate that our network produces
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark data sets, a data set from Bonn
University and the Bern-Barcelona data set. We conclude that modern deep
learning approaches can reach state-of-the-art performance on epileptic EEG

Semantic programming: method of $Δ_0^p$-enrichments and polynomial analogue of the Gandy fixed point theorem,Andrey Nechesov,"Computer programs fast entered in our life and the questions associated with

little resources as possible. Most often, such a ""measure of efficiency"" is the
polynomial program execution time of the length of the input data. Such
programs have great importance in the direction of smart contracts on

unprecedented spectral efficiency gains by utilizing $N$ passive reflecting

that the same delivery load can be achieved in the network with users of
unequal cache sizes, provided that the smallest cache size is greater than a
certain threshold. The MD2DDL is also characterized in the small cache size

Mask-guided Style Transfer Network for Purifying Real Images,"Tongtong Zhao, Yuxiao Yan, Jinjia Peng, Huibing Wang, Xianping Fu","Recently, the progress of learning-by-synthesis has proposed a training model
for synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of human and
material resources. However, due to the different distribution of synthetic
images compared with real images, the desired performance cannot be achieved.
To solve this problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the
realism of the synthetic images. Different from the previous methods, this
paper try to purify real image by extracting discriminative and robust features
to convert outdoor real images to indoor synthetic images. In this paper, we
first introduce the segmentation masks to construct RGB-mask pairs as inputs,
then we design a mask-guided style transfer network to learn style features
separately from the attention and bkgd(background) regions and learn content
features from full and attention region. Moreover, we propose a novel
region-level task-guided loss to restrain the features learnt from style and
content. Experiments were performed using mixed studies (qualitative and
quantitative) methods to demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images
in complex directions. We evaluate the proposed method on various public
datasets, including LPW, COCO and MPIIGaze. Experimental results show that the
proposed method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]

Querying Streaming System Monitoring Data for Enterprise System Anomaly Detection,"Peng Gao, Xusheng Xiao, Ding Li, Kangkook Jee, Haifeng Chen, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, Prateek Mittal","The need for countering Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks has led to
the solutions that ubiquitously monitor system activities in each enterprise
host, and perform timely abnormal system behavior detection over the stream of
monitoring data. However, existing stream-based solutions lack explicit
language constructs for expressing anomaly models that capture abnormal system
behaviors, thus facing challenges in incorporating expert knowledge to perform
timely anomaly detection over the large-scale monitoring data. To address these
limitations, we build SAQL, a novel stream-based query system that takes as
input, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in an enterprise,
and provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed to identify
abnormal behaviors based on the specified anomaly models. SAQL provides a
domain-specific query language, Stream-based Anomaly Query Language (SAQL),
that uniquely integrates critical primitives for expressing major types of
anomaly models. In the demo, we aim to show the complete usage scenario of SAQL
by (1) performing an APT attack in a controlled environment, and (2) using SAQL
to detect the abnormal behaviors in real time by querying the collected stream
of system monitoring data that contains the attack traces. The audience will
have the option to interact with the system and detect the attack footprints in
real time via issuing queries and checking the query results through a

Sum Spectral Efficiency Maximization in Massive MIMO Systems: Benefits from Deep Learning,"Trinh Van Chien, Emil Björnson, Erik G. Larsson","This paper investigates the joint data and pilot power optimization for
maximum sum spectral efficiency (SE) in multi-cell Massive MIMO systems, which

stationary point in polynomial time. We then use this algorithm together with
deep learning to train a convolutional neural network to perform the joint data
and pilot power control in sub-millisecond runtime, making it suitable for
online optimization in real multi-cell Massive MIMO systems. The numerical

Adaptive Hard Thresholding for Near-optimal Consistent Robust Regression,"Arun Sai Suggala, Kush Bhatia, Pradeep Ravikumar, Prateek Jain","We study the problem of robust linear regression with response variable
corruptions. We consider the oblivious adversary model, where the adversary
corrupts a fraction of the responses in complete ignorance of the data. We
provide a nearly linear time estimator which consistently estimates the true
regression vector, even with $1-o(1)$ fraction of corruptions. Existing results
in this setting either don't guarantee consistent estimates or can only handle
a small fraction of corruptions. We also extend our estimator to robust sparse
linear regression and show that similar guarantees hold in this setting.
Finally, we apply our estimator to the problem of linear regression with
heavy-tailed noise and show that our estimator consistently estimates the
regression vector even when the noise has unbounded variance (e.g., Cauchy
distribution), for which most existing results don't even apply. Our estimator
is based on a novel variant of outlier removal via hard thresholding in which
the threshold is chosen adaptively and crucially relies on randomness to escape

Dynamic Learning of Sequential Choice Bandit Problem under Marketing Fatigue,"Junyu Cao, Wei Sun","Motivated by the observation that overexposure to unwanted marketing
activities leads to customer dissatisfaction, we consider a setting where a
platform offers a sequence of messages to its users and is penalized when users
abandon the platform due to marketing fatigue. We propose a novel sequential
choice model to capture multiple interactions taking place between the platform
and its user: Upon receiving a message, a user decides on one of the three
actions: accept the message, skip and receive the next message, or abandon the
platform. Based on user feedback, the platform dynamically learns users'
abandonment distribution and their valuations of messages to determine the
length of the sequence and the order of the messages, while maximizing the
cumulative payoff over a horizon of length T. We refer to this online learning
task as the sequential choice bandit problem. For the offline combinatorial
optimization problem, we show that an efficient polynomial-time algorithm
exists. For the online problem, we propose an algorithm that balances
exploration and exploitation, and characterize its regret bound. Lastly, we

Error Bounds and Guidelines for Privacy Calibration in Differentially Private Kalman Filtering,"Kasra Yazdani, Matthew Hale","Differential privacy has emerged as a formal framework for protecting
sensitive information in control systems. One key feature is that it is immune
to post-processing, which means that arbitrary post-hoc computations can be
performed on privatized data without weakening differential privacy. It is
therefore common to filter private data streams. To characterize this setup, in
this paper we present error and entropy bounds for Kalman filtering
differentially private state trajectories. We consider systems in which an
output trajectory is privatized in order to protect the state trajectory that
produced it. We provide bounds on a priori and a posteriori error and
differential entropy of a Kalman filter which is processing the privatized
output trajectories. Using the error bounds we develop, we then provide
guidelines to calibrate privacy levels in order to keep filter error within
pre-specified bounds. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate these

Interactive segmentation of medical images through fully convolutional neural networks,"Tomas Sakinis, Fausto Milletari, Holger Roth, Panagiotis Korfiatis, Petro Kostandy, Kenneth Philbrick, Zeynettin Akkus, Ziyue Xu, Daguang Xu, Bradley J. Erickson","Image segmentation plays an essential role in medicine for both diagnostic
and interventional tasks. Segmentation approaches are either manual,
semi-automated or fully-automated. Manual segmentation offers full control over
the quality of the results, but is tedious, time consuming and prone to
operator bias. Fully automated methods require no human effort, but often
deliver sub-optimal results without providing users with the means to make
corrections. Semi-automated approaches keep users in control of the results by
providing means for interaction, but the main challenge is to offer a good
trade-off between precision and required interaction. In this paper we present
a deep learning (DL) based semi-automated segmentation approach that aims to be
a ""smart"" interactive tool for region of interest delineation in medical
images. We demonstrate its use for segmenting multiple organs on computed
tomography (CT) of the abdomen. Our approach solves some of the most pressing
clinical challenges: (i) it requires only one to a few user clicks to deliver
excellent 2D segmentations in a fast and reliable fashion; (ii) it can
generalize to previously unseen structures and ""corner cases""; (iii) it

Aligning Biomedical Metadata with Ontologies Using Clustering and Embeddings,"Rafael S. Gonçalves, Maulik R. Kamdar, Mark A. Musen","The metadata about scientific experiments published in online repositories
have been shown to suffer from a high degree of representational
heterogeneity---there are often many ways to represent the same type of
information, such as a geographical location via its latitude and longitude. To
harness the potential that metadata have for discovering scientific data, it is
crucial that they be represented in a uniform way that can be queried
effectively. One step toward uniformly-represented metadata is to normalize the
multiple, distinct field names used in metadata (e.g., lat lon, lat and long)
to describe the same type of value. To that end, we present a new method based
on clustering and embeddings (i.e., vector representations of words) to align
metadata field names with ontology terms. We apply our method to biomedical
metadata by generating embeddings for terms in biomedical ontologies from the

tasks using weak supervision via instructional narrations and an ordered list

of our approach is the observation that weakly supervised learning may be
easier if a model shares components while learning different steps: `pour egg'
should be trained jointly with other tasks involving `pour' and `egg'. We
formalize this in a component model for recognizing steps and a weakly
supervised learning framework that can learn this model under temporal
constraints from narration and the list of steps. Past data does not permit
systematic studying of sharing and so we also gather a new dataset, CrossTask,
aimed at assessing cross-task sharing. Our experiments demonstrate that sharing

How to Make Swarms Open-Ended? Evolving Collective Intelligence Through a Constricted Exploration of Adjacent Possibles,"Olaf Witkowski, Takashi Ikegami","We propose an approach of open-ended evolution via the simulation of swarm

the system towards transitions in innovation. We illustrate these three
components in a model computing the continuous evolution of a swarm of agents.
The results, divided in three distinct applications, show how emergent

Rational theories of language use have come under attack for decades for not

of referring expressions within the Rational Speech Act framework that treats
speakers as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of
utterances. Crucially, we relax the assumption that informativeness is computed

non-deterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a
large number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the
basic asymmetry in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than
size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in
overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in
nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light

The Average-Case Complexity of Counting Cliques in Erdos-Renyi Hypergraphs,"Enric Boix-Adserà, Matthew Brennan, Guy Bresler","We consider the problem of counting $k$-cliques in $s$-uniform Erdos-Renyi
hypergraphs $G(n,c,s)$ with edge density $c$, and show that its fine-grained
average-case complexity can be based on its worst-case complexity. We prove the
following:
1. Dense Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: Counting $k$-cliques on
$G(n,c,s)$ with $k$ and $c$ constant matches its worst-case time complexity up
to a $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor. Assuming ETH, it takes $n^{\Omega(k)}$ time
to count $k$-cliques in $G(n,c,s)$ if $k$ and $c$ are constant.
2. Sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: When $c = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$,
we give several algorithms exploiting the sparsity of $G(n, c, s)$ that are
faster than the best known worst-case algorithms. Complementing this, based on
a fine-grained worst-case assumption, our results imply a different
average-case phase diagram for each fixed $\alpha$ depicting a tradeoff between
a runtime lower bound and $k$. Surprisingly, in the hypergraph case ($s \ge
3$), these lower bounds are tight against our algorithms exactly when $c$ is
above the Erdős-Rényi $k$-clique percolation threshold.
This is the first known average-case hardness result on Erdős-Rényi

be used to actuate structures with large surface areas, to provide forces

transmissions based on arrays of elastic tubes. These sheet-like actuators can
strain, squeeze, bend, and conform to hard or soft objects of arbitrary shapes

actuators via facile apparel engineering methods, including computerized sewing
techniques. Together, these determine the distributions of stresses and strains
that can be generated by the FFMS. We present a simple mathematical model that
proves effective for predicting their performance. FFMS can operate at
frequencies of 5 Hertz or more, achieve engineering strains exceeding 100%, and
exert forces greater than 115 times their own weight. They can be safely used
in intimate contact with the human body even when delivering stresses exceeding
10$^\text{6}$ Pascals. We demonstrate their versatility for actuating a variety
of bodies or structures, and in configurations that perform multi-axis
actuation, including bending and shape change. As we also show, FFMS can be
used to exert forces on body tissues for wearable and biomedical applications.

"Simple, Fast, Accurate Intent Classification and Slot Labeling for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems","Arshit Gupta, John Hewitt, Katrin Kirchhoff","With the advent of conversational assistants, like Amazon Alexa, Google Now,
etc., dialogue systems are gaining a lot of traction, especially in industrial
setting. These systems typically consist of Spoken Language understanding
component which, in turn, consists of two tasks - Intent Classification (IC)

to achieve best performance. However, this joint modeling adds to model
obfuscation. In this work, we first design framework for a modularization of
joint IC-SL task to enhance architecture transparency. Then, we explore a
number of self-attention, convolutional, and recurrent models, contributing a

Design and Evaluation of Self-Assembled Actin-Based Nano-Communication,"Oussama Abderrahmane Dambri, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Biswadeep Chakraborty","The tremendous progress in nanotechnology over the last century, makes it
possible to engineer tiny nanodevices, which they need a nano-communication
network to interact. Two solutions are proposed in literature to create a
nano-communication system, either by using the classical electromagnetic
paradigm with Terahertz band, or using the bio-inspired molecular
communication. However, Terahertz is suffering from molecular absorption and
scattering losses at nano level, and the achievable throughput of molecular
communication is very low. In this paper, we propose a new solution to
establish a wired nano-communication. Self-assembled actin-based is a new
method that takes advantage of actin filaments self-assembly to create a nano
wire between a transmitter and a receiver, and use electrons as information
carriers. VPython framework is used in this paper to perform stochastic

Preprocessing Ambiguous Imprecise Points,"Ivor van der Hoog, Irina Kostitsyna, Maarten Löffler, Bettina Speckmann","Let ${R} = \{R_1, R_2, ..., R_n\}$ be a set of regions and let $ X = \{x_1,
x_2, ..., x_n\}$ be an (unknown) point set with $x_i \in R_i$. Region $R_i$
represents the uncertainty region of $x_i$. We consider the following question:
how fast can we establish order if we are allowed to preprocess the regions in
$R$? The preprocessing model of uncertainty uses two consecutive phases: a
preprocessing phase which has access only to ${R}$ followed by a reconstruction
phase during which a desired structure on $X$ is computed. Recent results in
this model parametrize the reconstruction time by the ply of ${R}$, which is
the maximum overlap between the regions in ${R}$. We introduce the ambiguity
$A({R})$ as a more fine-grained measure of the degree of overlap in ${R}$. We
show how to preprocess a set of $d$-dimensional disks in $O(n \log n)$ time
such that we can sort $X$ (if $d=1$) and reconstruct a quadtree on $X$ (if
$d\geq 1$ but constant) in $O(A({R}))$ time. If $A({R})$ is sub-linear, then
reporting the result dominates the running time of the reconstruction phase.
However, we can still return a suitable data structure representing the result
in $O(A({R}))$ time.
In one dimension, ${R}$ is a set of intervals and the ambiguity is linked to
interval entropy, which in turn relates to the well-studied problem of sorting
under partial information. The number of comparisons necessary to find the
linear order underlying a poset $P$ is lower-bounded by the graph entropy of
$P$. We show that if $P$ is an interval order, then the ambiguity provides a
constant-factor approximation of the graph entropy. This gives a lower bound of
$\Omega(A({R}))$ in all dimensions for the reconstruction phase (sorting or any
proximity structure), independent of any preprocessing; hence our result is
tight.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),,[Submitted on 19 Mar 2019]

Numerically Stable Polynomially Coded Computing,"Mohammad Fahim, Viveck R. Cadambe","We study the numerical stability of polynomial based encoding methods, which
has emerged to be a powerful class of techniques for providing straggler and
fault tolerance in the area of coded computing. Our contributions are as
follows: 1) We construct new codes for matrix multiplication that achieve the
same fault/straggler tolerance as the previously constructed MatDot Codes and
Polynomial Codes. Unlike previous codes that use polynomials expanded in a
monomial basis, our codes uses a basis of orthogonal polynomials. 2) We show
that the condition number of every $m \times m$ sub-matrix of an $m \times n, n
\geq m$ Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrix, evaluated on the $n$-point Chebyshev
grid, grows as $O(n^{2(n-m)})$ for $n > m$. An implication of this result is
that, when Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices are used for coded computing, for a
fixed number of redundant nodes $s=n-m,$ the condition number grows at most
polynomially in the number of nodes $n$. 3) By specializing our orthogonal
polynomial based constructions to Chebyshev polynomials, and using our
condition number bound for Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices, we construct new
numerically stable techniques for coded matrix multiplication. We empirically
demonstrate that our constructions have significantly lower numerical errors
compared to previous approaches which involve inversion of Vandermonde
matrices. We generalize our constructions to explore the trade-off between
computation/communication and fault-tolerance. 4) We propose a numerically
stable specialization of Lagrange coded computing. Motivated by our condition
number bound, our approach involves the choice of evaluation points and a
suitable decoding procedure that involves inversion of an appropriate
Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrix. Our approach is demonstrated empirically to have
lower numerical errors as compared to standard methods.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,"[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 22 May 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Walking with Confidence: Safety Regulation for Full Order Biped Models,"Nils Smit-Anseeuw, C. David Remy, Ram Vasudevan","Safety guarantees are valuable in the control of walking robots, as falling
can be both dangerous and costly. Unfortunately, set-based tools for generating
safety guarantees (such as sums-of-squares optimization) are typically
restricted to simplified, low-dimensional models of walking robots. For more
complex models, methods based on hybrid zero dynamics can ensure the local
stability of a pre-specified limit cycle, but provide limited guarantees. This
paper combines the benefits of both approaches by using sums-of-squares
optimization on a hybrid zero dynamics manifold to generate a guaranteed safe
set for a 10-dimensional walking robot model. Along with this set, this paper
describes how to generate a controller that maintains safety by modifying the
manifold parameters when on the edge of the safe set. The proposed approach,
which is applied to a bipedal Rabbit model, provides a roadmap for applying
sums-of-squares verification techniques to high dimensional systems. This opens
the door for a broad set of tools that can generate safety guarantees and

On Sampling Random Features From Empirical Leverage Scores: Implementation and Theoretical Guarantees,"Shahin Shahrampour, Soheil Kolouri","Random features provide a practical framework for large-scale kernel
approximation and supervised learning. It has been shown that data-dependent

introduce an optimized distribution for features based on an
infinite-dimensional integral operator (depending on input distribution), which
is impractical to sample from. Focusing on empirical leverage scores in this
paper, we establish an out-of-sample performance bound, revealing an
interesting trade-off between the approximated kernel and the eigenvalue decay
of another kernel in the domain of random features defined based on data
distribution. Our experiments verify that the empirical algorithm consistently

On Computing the Number of Short Cycles in Bipartite Graphs Using the Spectrum of the Directed Edge Matrix,"Ali Dehghan, Amir H. Banihashemi","Counting short cycles in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem of
interest in many fields including the analysis and design of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. There are two computational approaches to count
short cycles (with length smaller than $2g$, where $g$ is the girth of the
graph) in bipartite graphs. The first approach is applicable to a general
(irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum $\{\eta_i\}$ of the directed
edge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity $N_k$ of $k$-cycles with
$k < 2g$ through the simple equation $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$. This
approach has a computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$, where $|E|$ is
number of edges in the graph. The second approach is only applicable to
bi-regular bipartite graphs, and uses the spectrum $\{\lambda_i\}$ of the
adjacency matrix (graph spectrum) and the degree sequences of the graph to
compute $N_k$. The complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$, where
$|V|$ is number of nodes in the graph. This complexity is less than that of the
first approach, but the equations involved in the computations of the second
approach are very tedious, particularly for $k \geq g+6$. In this paper, we
establish an analytical relationship between the two spectra $\{\eta_i\}$ and
$\{\lambda_i\}$ for bi-regular bipartite graphs. Through this relationship, the
former spectrum can be derived from the latter through simple equations. This
allows the computation of $N_k$ using $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$ but with a
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$ rather than $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$.",Information Theory (cs.IT),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]

lack of efficient algorithm for attacking kNN classifiers with large k and
high-dimensional data. We propose a heuristic attack that allows us to use
gradient descent to find adversarial examples for kNN classifiers, and then

Indexes in Microsoft SQL Server,Sourav Mukherjee,"Indexes are the best apposite choice for quickly retrieving the records. This
is nothing but cutting down the number of Disk IO. Instead of scanning the
complete table for the results, we can decrease the number of IO's or page
fetches using index structures such as B-Trees or Hash Indexes to retrieve the
data faster. The most convenient way to consider an index is to think like a
dictionary. It has words and its corresponding definitions against those words.
The dictionary will have an index on ""word"" because when we open a dictionary
and we want to fetch its corresponding word quickly, then find its definition.
The dictionary generally contains just a single index - an index ordered by
word. When we modify any record and change the corresponding value of an
indexed column in a clustered index, the database might require moving the
entire row into a separately new position to maintain the rows in the sorted
order. This action is essentially turned into an update query into a DELETE
followed by an INSERT, and it decreases the performance of the query. The
clustered index in the table can often be available on the primary key or a
foreign key column because key values usually do not modify once a record is
injected into the database.",Databases (cs.DB),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Video Object Segmentation-based Visual Servo Control and Object Depth Estimation on a Mobile Robot,"Brent A. Griffin, Victoria Florence, Jason J. Corso","To be useful in everyday environments, robots must be able to identify and

celebrated Birkhoff's representation theorem. ${\rm M}^{\natural}$-concavity is

the class of ${\rm M}^{\natural}$-concavity is a proper subclass of

Photon-Flooded Single-Photon 3D Cameras,"Anant Gupta, Atul Ingle, Andreas Velten, Mohit Gupta","Single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are starting to play a pivotal role in
the development of photon-efficient, long-range LiDAR systems. However, due to
non-linearities in their image formation model, a high photon flux (e.g., due
to strong sunlight) leads to distortion of the incident temporal waveform, and
potentially, large depth errors. Operating SPADs in low flux regimes can
mitigate these distortions, but, often requires attenuating the signal and
thus, results in low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we address the
following basic question: what is the optimal photon flux that a SPAD-based
LiDAR should be operated in? We derive a closed form expression for the optimal
flux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light
strength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real
world scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is
conventionally suggested for avoiding distortions. We propose a simple,
adaptive approach for achieving the optimal flux by attenuating incident flux
based on an estimate of ambient light strength. Using extensive simulations and
a hardware prototype, we show that the optimal flux criterion holds for several

optimization problem that seeks to maximize the sum of a sum-sum diversity

function addresses the redundancy, and the submodular function controls the
predictive quality. We consider the problem in big data settings (in other
words, distributed and streaming settings) where the data cannot be stored on a
single machine or the process time is too high for a single machine. We show
that a greedy algorithm achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal
solution in these settings. Moreover, we formulate the multi-label feature

sequence, has been lately attracting more attention in the computer vision

However, there are two obstacles for lifelong learning of deep neural networks:
catastrophic forgetting and capacity limitation. To solve the above issues,

A Novel Dynamic Programming Approach to the Train Marshalling Problem,"Hossein Falsafain, Mohammad Tamannaei","Train marshalling is the process of reordering the railcars of a train in
such a way that the railcars with the same destination appear consecutively in
the final, reassembled train. The process takes place in the shunting yard by
means of a number of classification tracks. In the Train Marshalling Problem
(TMP), the objective is to perform this rearrangement of the railcars with the
use of as few classification tracks as possible. The problem has been shown to
be NP-hard, and several exact and approximation algorithms have been developed
for it. In this paper, we propose a novel exact dynamic programming (DP)
algorithm for the TMP. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm (which
is exponential in the number of destinations and linear in the number of
railcars) is lower than that of the best presently available algorithm for the
problem, which is an inclusion-exclusion-based DP algorithm. In practice, the
proposed algorithm can provide a substantially improved performance compared to
its inclusion-exclusion-based counterpart, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.",Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Uncertainty quantification of molecular property prediction with Bayesian neural networks,"Seongok Ryu, Yongchan Kwon, Woo Youn Kim","Deep neural networks have outperformed existing machine learning models in
various molecular applications. In practical applications, it is still
difficult to make confident decisions because of the uncertainty in predictions
arisen from insufficient quality and quantity of training data. Here, we show
that Bayesian neural networks are useful to quantify the uncertainty of
molecular property prediction with three numerical experiments. In particular,
it enables us to decompose the predictive variance into the model- and
data-driven uncertainties, which helps to elucidate the source of errors. In
the logP predictions, we show that data noise affected the data-driven
uncertainties more significantly than the model-driven ones. Based on this
analysis, we were able to find unexpected errors in the Harvard Clean Energy
Project dataset. Lastly, we show that the confidence of prediction is closely
related to the predictive uncertainty by performing on bio-activity and
toxicity classification problems.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Combinatorial Auctions with Interdependent Valuations: SOS to the Rescue,"Alon Eden, Michal Feldman, Amos Fiat, Kira Goldner, Anna R. Karlin","We study combinatorial auctions with interdependent valuations. In such
settings, each agent $i$ has a private signal $s_i$ that captures her private
information, and the valuation function of every agent depends on the entire
signal profile, ${\bf s}=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$. The literature in economics shows
that the interdependent model gives rise to strong impossibility results, and
identifies assumptions under which optimal solutions can be attained. The
computer science literature provides approximation results for simple
single-parameter settings (mostly single item auctions, or matroid feasibility
constraints). Both bodies of literature focus largely on valuations satisfying
a technical condition termed {\em single crossing} (or variants thereof).
We consider the class of {\em submodular over signals} (SOS) valuations
(without imposing any single-crossing type assumption), and provide the first
welfare approximation guarantees for multi-dimensional combinatorial auctions,
achieved by universally ex-post IC-IR mechanisms. Our main results are: $(i)$
4-approximation for any single-parameter downward-closed setting with
single-dimensional signals and SOS valuations; $(ii)$ 4-approximation for any
combinatorial auction with multi-dimensional signals and {\em separable}-SOS
valuations; and $(iii)$ $(k+3)$- and $(2\log(k)+4)$-approximation for any
combinatorial auction with single-dimensional signals, with $k$-sized signal
space, for SOS and strong-SOS valuations, respectively. All of our results
extend to a parameterized version of SOS, $d$-SOS, while losing a factor that
depends on $d$.",Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),,"[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 2 Jun 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Convolution with even-sized kernels and symmetric padding,"Shuang Wu, Guanrui Wang, Pei Tang, Feng Chen, Luping Shi","Compact convolutional neural networks gain efficiency mainly through
depthwise convolutions, expanded channels and complex topologies, which
contrarily aggravate the training process. Besides, 3x3 kernels dominate the
spatial representation in these models, whereas even-sized kernels (2x2, 4x4)
are rarely adopted. In this work, we quantify the shift problem occurs in
even-sized kernel convolutions by an information erosion hypothesis, and
eliminate it by proposing symmetric padding on four sides of the feature maps
(C2sp, C4sp). Symmetric padding releases the generalization capabilities of
even-sized kernels at little computational cost, making them outperform 3x3
kernels in image classification and generation tasks. Moreover, C2sp obtains
comparable accuracy to emerging compact models with much less memory and time
consumption during training. Symmetric padding coupled with even-sized
convolutions can be neatly implemented into existing frameworks, providing
effective elements for architecture designs, especially on online and continual
learning occasions where training efforts are emphasized.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,"[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 22 May 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Dynamic Geometric Data Structures via Shallow Cuttings,Timothy M. Chan,"We present new results on a number of fundamental problems about dynamic
geometric data structures:
1. We describe the first fully dynamic data structures with sublinear
amortized update time for maintaining (i) the number of vertices or the volume
of the convex hull of a 3D point set, (ii) the largest empty circle for a 2D
point set, (iii) the Hausdorff distance between two 2D point sets, (iv) the
discrete 1-center of a 2D point set, (v)the number of maximal (i.e., skyline)
points in a 3D point set. The update times are near $n^{11/12}$ for (i) and
(ii), $n^{7/8}$ for (iii) and (iv), and $n^{2/3}$ for (v). Previously,
sublinear bounds were known only for restricted `semi-online' settings [Chan,
SODA 2002].
2. We slightly improve previous fully dynamic data structures for answering
extreme point queries for the convex hull of a 3D point set and nearest
neighbor search for a 2D point set. The query time is $O(\log^2n)$, and the
amortized update time is $O(\log^4n)$ instead of $O(\log^5n)$ [Chan, SODA 2006;
Kaplan et al., SODA 2017].
3. We also improve previous fully dynamic data structures for maintaining the
bichromatic closest pair between two 2D point sets and the diameter of a 2D

Contextual Compositionality Detection with External Knowledge Bases andWord Embeddings,"Dongsheng Wang, Quichi Li, Lucas Chaves Lima, Jakob grue Simonsen, Christina Lioma","When the meaning of a phrase cannot be inferred from the individual meanings
of its words (e.g., hot dog), that phrase is said to be non-compositional.
Automatic compositionality detection in multi-word phrases is critical in any
application of semantic processing, such as search engines; failing to detect
non-compositional phrases can hurt system effectiveness notably. Existing
research treats phrases as either compositional or non-compositional in a
deterministic manner. In this paper, we operationalize the viewpoint that
compositionality is contextual rather than deterministic, i.e., that whether a
phrase is compositional or non-compositional depends on its context. For
example, the phrase `green card' is compositional when referring to a green
colored card, whereas it is non-compositional when meaning permanent residence
authorization. We address the challenge of detecting this type of contextual
compositionality as follows: given a multi-word phrase, we enrich the word
embedding representing its semantics with evidence about its global context
(terms it often collocates with) as well as its local context (narratives where
that phrase is used, which we call usage scenarios). We further extend this
representation with information extracted from external knowledge bases. The
resulting representation incorporates both localized context and more general
usage of the phrase and allows to detect its compositionality in a
non-deterministic and contextual way. Empirical evaluation of our model on a
dataset of phrase compositionality, manually collected by crowdsourcing
contextual compositionality assessments, shows that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines notably on detecting phrase compositionality.",Computation and Language (cs.CL),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
IEEE 802.11bd & 5G NR V2X: Evolution of Radio Access Technologies for V2X Communications,"Gaurang Naik, Biplav Choudhury, Jung-Min (Jerry)Park","With rising interest in autonomous vehicles, developing radio access
technologies (RATs) that enable reliable and low latency vehicular
communications has become of paramount importance. Dedicated Short Range
Communications (DSRC) and Cellular V2X (C-V2X) are two present-day technologies
that are capable of supporting day-1 vehicular applications. However, these
RATs fall short of supporting communication requirements of many advanced
vehicular applications, which are believed to be critical in enabling fully
autonomous vehicles. Both DSRC and C-V2X are undergoing extensive enhancements
in order to support advanced vehicular applications that are characterized by
high reliability, low latency and high throughput requirements. These RAT
evolutions---IEEE 802.11bd for DSRC and NR V2X for C-V2X---can supplement
today's vehicular sensors in enabling autonomous driving. In this paper, we
briefly describe the two present-day vehicular RATs. In doing so, we highlight
their inability to guarantee quality of service requirements of many advanced
vehicular applications. We then look at the two RAT evolutions, i.e., IEEE
802.11bd and NR V2X and outline their objectives, describe their salient
features and provide an in-depth description of key mechanisms that enable
these features. While both, IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X, are in their initial

Modelling Graph Errors: Towards Robust Graph Signal Processing,"Jari Miettinen, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, Esa Ollila","The first step for any graph signal processing (GSP) procedure is to learn
the graph signal representation, i.e., to capture the dependence structure of
the data into an adjacency matrix. Indeed, the adjacency matrix is typically
not known a priori and has to be learned. However, it is learned with errors. A
little attention has been paid to modelling such errors in the adjacency
matrix, and studying their effects on GSP methods. However, modelling errors in
the adjacency matrix will enable both to study the graph error effects in GSP
and to develop robust GSP algorithms. In this paper, we therefore introduce
practically justifiable graph error models. We also study, both analytically
when possible and numerically, the graph error effect on the performance of GSP
methods in different types of problems such as filtering of graph signals and
independent component analysis of graph signals (graph decorrelation).",Information Theory (cs.IT),,"[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 25 Sep 2020 (this version, v2)]"
Neural Check-Worthiness Ranking with Weak Supervision: Finding Sentences for Fact-Checking,"Casper Hansen, Christian Hansen, Stephen Alstrup, Jakob Grue Simonsen, Christina Lioma","Automatic fact-checking systems detect misinformation, such as fake news, by
(i) selecting check-worthy sentences for fact-checking, (ii) gathering related
information to the sentences, and (iii) inferring the factuality of the
sentences. Most prior research on (i) uses hand-crafted features to select
check-worthy sentences, and does not explicitly account for the recent finding
that the top weighted terms in both check-worthy and non-check-worthy sentences
are actually overlapping [15]. Motivated by this, we present a neural
check-worthiness sentence ranking model that represents each word in a sentence
by \textit{both} its embedding (aiming to capture its semantics) and its
syntactic dependencies (aiming to capture its role in modifying the semantics
of other terms in the sentence). Our model is an end-to-end trainable neural
network for check-worthiness ranking, which is trained on large amounts of
unlabelled data through weak supervision. Thorough experimental evaluation
against state of the art baselines, with and without weak supervision, shows
our model to be superior at all times (+13% in MAP and +28% at various
Precision cut-offs from the best baseline with statistical significance).
Empirical analysis of the use of weak supervision, word embedding pretraining
on domain-specific data, and the use of syntactic dependencies of our model

Modelling Sequential Music Track Skips using a Multi-RNN Approach,"Christian Hansen, Casper Hansen, Stephen Alstrup, Jakob Grue Simonsen, Christina Lioma","Modelling sequential music skips provides streaming companies the ability to

we build TBar, a straightforward APR tool that systematically attempts to apply
these fix patterns to program bugs. We thoroughly evaluate TBar on the
Defects4J benchmark. In particular, we assess the actual qualitative and
quantitative diversity of fix patterns, as well as their effectiveness in
yielding plausible or correct patches. Eventually, we find that, assuming a
perfect fault localization, TBar correctly/plausibly fixes 74/101 bugs.

Counterexample-Guided Strategy Improvement for POMDPs Using Recurrent Neural Networks,"Steven Carr, Nils Jansen, Ralf Wimmer, Alexandru C. Serban, Bernd Becker, Ufuk Topcu","We study strategy synthesis for partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs). The particular problem is to determine strategies that

we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode POMDP strategies. The RNN
accounts for memory-based decisions without the need to expand the full belief
space of a POMDP. Secondly, we restrict the RNN-based strategy to represent a
finite-memory strategy and implement it on a specific POMDP. For the resulting
finite Markov chain, efficient formal verification techniques provide provable
guarantees against temporal logic specifications. If the specification is not
satisfied, counterexamples supply diagnostic information. We use this
information to improve the strategy by iteratively training the RNN. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed method elevates the state of the art in

How Far are we from Data Mining Democratisation? A Systematic Review,"Alfonso de la Vega, Diego García-Saiz, Marta Zorrilla, Pablo Sánchez","Context: Data mining techniques have demonstrated to be a powerful technique
for discovering insights hidden in data from a domain. However, these
techniques demand very specialised skills. People willing to analyse data often
lack these skills, so they must rely on data scientists, which hinders data
mining democratisation. Different approaches have appeared in the last years to
address this issue.
Objective: Analyse the state of the art to know how far are we from an
effective data mining democratisation, what has already been accomplished, and
what should be done in the upcoming years.
Method: We performed a state-of-the-art review following a systematic and
objective procedure, which included works both from the academia and the
industry. The reviewed works were grouped in four categories. Each category was
then evaluated in detail using a well-defined evaluation criteria to identify
its strengths and weaknesses.
Results: Around 700 works were initially considered, from which 43 were
finally selected for a more in-depth analysis. Only two out of the four
identified categories provide effective solutions to data mining
democratisation. From these two categories, one always requires a minimum
intervention of a data scientist, whereas the other one does not provide
support for all the stages of the data mining process, and might exhibit
accuracy problems in some contexts.
Conclusion: In all analysed approaches, a data scientist is still required to
perform some steps of the analysis process. Moreover, automated approaches that
do not require data scientists for some steps expose some problems in other
quality attributes, such as accuracy. Therefore, although existent work shows
some promising initial steps, we are still far from data mining
democratisation.",Databases (cs.DB),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]

that for a near-separated polynomial, i.e., polynomials of the form
$F(x,y)=f_1(x)f_2(y)-f_2(x)f_1(y)$, then $F(x,y)+r$ is always irreducible for
any constant $r$ different from zero. We also provide the biggest known family
of HIP polynomials in several variables. These are polynomials
$p(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ over a zero characteristic field $K$
such that $p(h_1(x_1),\ldots,h_n(x_n))$ is irreducible over $K$ for every

Left-to-Right Dependency Parsing with Pointer Networks,"Daniel Fernández-González, Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez","We propose a novel transition-based algorithm that straightforwardly parses

directly point to a position from the sentence. However, our left-to-right
approach is simpler than the original top-down stack-pointer parser (not
requiring a stack) and reduces transition sequence length in half, from 2$n$-1
actions to $n$. This results in a quadratic non-projective parser that runs
twice as fast as the original while achieving the best accuracy to date on the

Smart Edition of MIDI Files,"Pierre Roy, Francois Pachet","We address the issue of editing musical performance data, in particular MIDI
files representing human musical performances. Editing such sequences raises
specific issues due to the ambiguous nature of musical objects. The first
source of ambiguity is that musicians naturally produce many deviations from
the metrical frame. These deviations may be intentional or subconscious, but
they play an important role in conveying the groove or feeling of a
performance. Relations between musical elements are also usually implicit,
creating even more ambiguity. A note is in relation with the surrounding notes
in many possible ways: it can be part of a melodic pattern, it can also play a
harmonic role with the simultaneous notes, or be a pedal-tone. All these
aspects play an essential role that should be preserved, as much as possible,
when editing musical sequences.
In this paper, we contribute specifically to the problem of editing
non-quantized, metrical musical sequences represented as MIDI files. We first
list of number of problems caused by the use of naive edition operations
applied to performance data, using a motivating example. We then introduce a
model, called Dancing MIDI, based on 1) two desirable, well-defined properties
for edit operations and 2) two well-defined operations, Split and Concat, with
an implementation. We show that our model formally satisfies the two
properties, and that it prevents most of the problems that occur with naive

In Defense of Pre-trained ImageNet Architectures for Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Road-driving Images,"Marin Oršić, Ivan Krešo, Petra Bevandić, Siniša Šegvić","Recent success of semantic segmentation approaches on demanding road driving
datasets has spurred interest in many related application fields. Many of these
applications involve real-time prediction on mobile platforms such as cars,
drones and various kinds of robots. Real-time setup is challenging due to
extraordinary computational complexity involved. Many previous works address
the challenge with custom lightweight architectures which decrease
computational complexity by reducing depth, width and layer capacity with
respect to general purpose architectures. We propose an alternative approach
which achieves a significantly better performance across a wide range of
computing budgets. First, we rely on a light-weight general purpose

upsampling with lateral connections as the most cost-effective solution to
restore the prediction resolution. Finally, we propose to enlarge the receptive
field by fusing shared features at multiple resolutions in a novel fashion.
Experiments on several road driving datasets show a substantial advantage of
the proposed approach, either with ImageNet pre-trained parameters or when we

Combining Coarse and Fine Physics for Manipulation using Parallel-in-Time Integration,"Wisdom C. Agboh, Daniel Ruprecht, Mehmet R. Dogar","We present a method for fast and accurate physics-based predictions during
non-prehensile manipulation planning and control. Given an initial state and a
sequence of controls, the problem of predicting the resulting sequence of
states is a key component of a variety of model-based planning and control
algorithms. We propose combining a coarse (i.e. computationally cheap but not
very accurate) predictive physics model, with a fine (i.e. computationally
expensive but accurate) predictive physics model, to generate a hybrid model
that is at the required speed and accuracy for a given manipulation task. Our
approach is based on the Parareal algorithm, a parallel-in-time integration
method used for computing numerical solutions for general systems of ordinary
differential equations. We adapt Parareal to combine a coarse pushing model
with an off-the-shelf physics engine to deliver physics-based predictions that
are as accurate as the physics engine but run in substantially less wall-clock
time, thanks to parallelization across time. We use these physics-based
predictions in a model-predictive-control framework based on trajectory
optimization, to plan pushing actions that avoid an obstacle and reach a goal
location. We show that with hybrid physics models, we can achieve the same
success rates as the planner that uses the off-the-shelf physics engine

Three-dimensional Segmentation of Trees Through a Flexible Multi-Class Graph Cut Algorithm (MCGC),"Jonathan Williams, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Tom Swinfield, Juheon Lee, Xiaohao Cai, Lan Qie, David A. Coomes","Developing a robust algorithm for automatic individual tree crown (ITC)
detection from laser scanning datasets is important for tracking the responses
of trees to anthropogenic change. Such approaches allow the size, growth and
mortality of individual trees to be measured, enabling forest carbon stocks and
dynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally
simple forests including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust
solution for structurally complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a
challenge; existing segmentation algorithms often perform less well than simple
area-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass. Here we describe a
Multi-Class Graph Cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses
local three-dimensional geometry and density information, alongside knowledge
of crown allometries, to segment individual tree crowns from LiDAR point
clouds. Our approach robustly identifies trees in the top and intermediate
layers of the canopy, but cannot recognise small trees. From these
three-dimensional crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass.
Comparing these estimates to those from permanent inventory plots, our

EVMFuzz: Differential Fuzz Testing of Ethereum Virtual Machine,"Ying Fu, Meng Ren, Fuchen Ma, Yu Jiang, Heyuan Shi, Jiaguang Sun","Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the run-time environment for smart
contracts and its vulnerabilities may lead to serious problems to the Ethereum
ecology. With lots of techniques being developed for the validation of smart
contracts, the security problems of EVM have not been well-studied. In this
paper, we propose EVMFuzz, aiming to detect vulnerabilities of EVMs with
differential fuzz testing. The core idea of EVMFuzz is to continuously generate
seed contracts for different EVMs' execution, so as to find as many
inconsistencies among execution results as possible, eventually discover
vulnerabilities with output cross-referencing. First, we present the evaluation
metric for the internal inconsistency indicator, such as the opcode sequence
executed and gas used. Then, we construct seed contracts via a set of
predefined mutators and employ dynamic priority scheduling algorithm to guide
seed contracts selection and maximize the inconsistency. Finally, we leverage
different EVMs as crossreferencing oracles to avoid manual checking of the
execution output. For evaluation, we conducted large-scale mutation on 36,295
real-world smart contracts and generated 253,153 smart contracts. Among them,
66.2% showed differential performance, including 1,596 variant contracts
triggered inconsistent output among EVMs. Accompanied by manual root cause
analysis, we found 5 previously unknown security bugs in four widely used EVMs,

Drawing planar graphs with few segments on a polynomial grid,"Philipp Kindermann, Tamara Mchedlidze, Thomas Schneck, Antonios Symvonis","The visual complexity of a graph drawing can be measured by the number of

such a drawing, one segment may represent multiple edges forming a path.
Drawings of planar graphs with few segments were intensively studied in the
past years. However, the area requirements were only considered for limited
subclasses of planar graphs. In this paper, we show that trees have drawings
with $3n/4-1$ segments and $n^2$ area, improving the previous result of

Efficient Reward-Based Structural Plasticity on a SpiNNaker 2 Prototype,"Yexin Yan, David Kappel, Felix Neumaerker, Johannes Partzsch, Bernhard Vogginger, Sebastian Hoeppner, Steve Furber, Wolfgang Maass, Robert Legenstein, Christian Mayr","Advances in neuroscience uncover the mechanisms employed by the brain to
efficiently solve complex learning tasks with very limited resources. However,
the efficiency is often lost when one tries to port these findings to a silicon
substrate, since brain-inspired algorithms often make extensive use of complex
functions such as random number generators, that are expensive to compute on
standard general purpose hardware. The prototype chip of the 2nd generation
SpiNNaker system is designed to overcome this problem. Low-power ARM processors
equipped with a random number generator and an exponential function accelerator
enable the efficient execution of brain-inspired algorithms. We implement the
recently introduced reward-based synaptic sampling model that employs
structural plasticity to learn a function or task. The numerical simulation of
the model requires to update the synapse variables in each time step including
an explorative random term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most
complex synapse model implemented so far on the SpiNNaker system. By making
efficient use of the hardware accelerators and numerical optimizations the
computation time of one plasticity update is reduced by a factor of 2. This,
combined with fitting the model into to the local SRAM, leads to 62% energy
reduction compared to the case without accelerators and the use of external
DRAM. The model implementation is integrated into the SpiNNaker software
framework allowing for scalability onto larger systems. The hardware-software
system presented in this work paves the way for power-efficient mobile and

Preference rules for label ranking: Mining patterns in multi-target relations,"Cláudio Rebelo de Sá, Paulo Azevedo, Carlos Soares, Alípio Mário Jorge, Arno Knobbe","In this paper we investigate two variants of association rules for preference
data, Label Ranking Association Rules and Pairwise Association Rules. Label
Ranking Association Rules (LRAR) are the equivalent of Class Association Rules
(CAR) for the Label Ranking task. In CAR, the consequent is a single class, to
which the example is expected to belong to. In LRAR, the consequent is a
ranking of the labels. The generation of LRAR requires special support and
confidence measures to assess the similarity of rankings. In this work, we
carry out a sensitivity analysis of these similarity-based measures. We want to
understand which datasets benefit more from such measures and which parameters
have more influence in the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative type of rules, the Pairwise Association Rules (PAR), which are
defined as association rules with a set of pairwise preferences in the

Representative Datasets: The Perceptron Case,"Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz, Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo, Eduardo Paluzo-Hidalgo","One of the main drawbacks of the practical use of neural networks is the long
time needed in the training process. Such training process consists in an
iterative change of parameters trying to minimize a loss function. These
changes are driven by a dataset, which can be seen as a set of labeled points
in an n-dimensional space. In this paper, we explore the concept of it
representative dataset which is smaller than the original dataset and satisfies
a nearness condition independent of isometric transformations. The
representativeness is measured using persistence diagrams due to its
computational efficiency. We also prove that the accuracy of the learning
process of a neural network on a representative dataset is comparable with the
accuracy on the original dataset when the neural network architecture is a
perceptron and the loss function is the mean squared error. These theoretical

Ontology of Card Sleights,Aaron Sterling,"We present a machine-readable movement writing for sleight-of-hand moves with

fostering helping behaviors, users would help themselves as well. Finally, we

Prioritized Process Test: An Alternative to Current Process Testing Strategies,"Miroslav Bures, Bestoun S. Ahmed, Kamal Z. Zamli","Testing processes and workflows in information and Internet of Things systems
is a major part of the typical software testing effort. Consistent and
efficient path-based test cases are desired to support these tests. Because
certain parts of software system workflows have a higher business priority than
others, this fact has to be involved in the generation of test cases. In this
paper, we propose a Prioritized Process Test (PPT), which is a model-based test
case generation algorithm that represents an alternative to currently
established algorithms that use directed graphs and test requirements to model
the system under test. The PPT accepts a directed multigraph as a model to
express priorities, and edge weights are used instead of test requirements. To
determine the test-coverage level of test cases, a test-depth-level concept is
used. We compared the presented PPT with five alternatives (i.e., the Process
Cycle Test, a naive reduction of test set created by the Process Cycle Test,
Brute Force algorithm, Set-covering Based Solution and Matching-based Prefix
Graph Solution) for edge coverage and edge-pair coverage. To assess the
optimality of the path-based test cases produced by these strategies, we used
fourteen metrics based on the properties of these test cases and 59 models that
were created for three real-world systems. For all edge coverage, the PPT
produced more optimal test cases than the alternatives in terms of the majority
of the metrics. For edge-pair coverage, the PPT strategy yielded similar
results to those of the alternatives. Thus, the PPT strategy is an applicable
alternative, as it reflects both the required test coverage level and the
business priority in parallel.",Software Engineering (cs.SE),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Segmentation-Based Deep-Learning Approach for Surface-Defect Detection,"Domen Tabernik, Samo Šela, Jure Skvarč, Danijel Skočaj","Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an
interesting and promising area of research, with a very high and direct impact
on the application domain of visual inspection. Deep-learning methods have
become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection
system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of
exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning
architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface
anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection.
The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small
number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical
applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning
methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the
proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of
surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the
required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples
and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly
created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates
that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected
surfaces, using only approximately 25-30 defective training samples, instead of
hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications.
This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the

Learning Gentle Object Manipulation with Curiosity-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Sandy H. Huang, Martina Zambelli, Jackie Kay, Murilo F. Martins, Yuval Tassa, Patrick M. Pilarski, Raia Hadsell","Robots must know how to be gentle when they need to interact with fragile
objects, or when the robot itself is prone to wear and tear. We propose an
approach that enables deep reinforcement learning to train policies that are
gentle, both during exploration and task execution. In a reward-based learning
environment, a natural approach involves augmenting the (task) reward with a
penalty for non-gentleness, which can be defined as excessive impact force.
However, augmenting with only this penalty impairs learning: policies get stuck
in a local optimum which avoids all contact with the environment. Prior
research has shown that combining auxiliary tasks or intrinsic rewards can be
beneficial for stabilizing and accelerating learning in sparse-reward domains,
and indeed we find that introducing a surprise-based intrinsic reward does
avoid the no-contact failure case. However, we show that a simple
dynamics-based surprise is not as effective as penalty-based surprise.
Penalty-based surprise, based on predicting forceful contacts, has a further
benefit: it encourages exploration which is contact-rich yet gentle. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a complex, tendon-powered
robot hand with tactile sensors. Videos are available at

OCGAN: One-class Novelty Detection Using GANs with Constrained Latent Representations,"Pramuditha Perera, Ramesh Nallapati, Bing Xiang","We present a novel model called OCGAN for the classical problem of one-class
novelty detection, where, given a set of examples from a particular class, the
goal is to determine if a query example is from the same class. Our solution is
based on learning latent representations of in-class examples using a denoising
auto-encoder network. The key contribution of our work is our proposal to
explicitly constrain the latent space to exclusively represent the given class.
In order to accomplish this goal, firstly, we force the latent space to have
bounded support by introducing a tanh activation in the encoder's output layer.
Secondly, using a discriminator in the latent space that is trained
adversarially, we ensure that encoded representations of in-class examples
resemble uniform random samples drawn from the same bounded space. Thirdly,
using a second adversarial discriminator in the input space, we ensure all
randomly drawn latent samples generate examples that look real. Finally, we
introduce a gradient-descent based sampling technique that explores points in
the latent space that generate potential out-of-class examples, which are fed
back to the network to further train it to generate in-class examples from
those points. The effectiveness of the proposed method is measured across four

the maximum weighted energy and service delay cost (WEDC) of all users. First,
we consider a scenario where data compression is performed only at the mobile

techniques is developed to optimize the compression ratios and the resource

efficient algorithms to overcome the strong coupling between the offloading

Identifying Maximal Non-Redundant Integer Cone Generators,"Slobodan Mitrović, Ruzica Piskac, Viktor Kunčak","A non-redundant integer cone generator (NICG) of dimension $d$ is a set $S$
of vectors from $\{0,1\}^d$ whose vector sum cannot be generated as a positive
integer linear combination of a proper subset of $S$. The largest possible
cardinality of NICG of a dimension $d$, denoted by $N(d)$, provides an upper
bound on the sparsity of systems of integer equations with a large number of
integer variables. A better estimate of $N(d)$ means that we can consider
smaller sub-systems of integer equations when solving systems with many integer
variables. Furthermore, given that we can reduce constraints on set algebra
expressions to constraints on cardinalities of Venn regions, tighter upper
bound on $N(d)$ yields a more efficient decision procedure for a logic of sets
with cardinality constraints (BAPA), which has been applied in software
verification. Previous attempts to compute $N(d)$ using SAT solvers have not
succeeded even for $d=3$. The only known values were computed manually:
$N(d)=d$ for $d < 4$ and $N(4) > 4$. We provide the first exact values for $d >

improvement of the known asymptotic bound (which would give only e.g. $N(6) \le

to decouple rotation, translation, and scale estimation, which allows solving

Connection and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Based YOLO) approach for ameliorating
the object detection accuracy of YOLOv2. Specifically, the dense connection of
convolution layers is employed in the backbone network of YOLOv2 to strengthen
the feature extraction and alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem. Moreover,
an improved spatial pyramid pooling is introduced to pool and concatenate the
multi-scale local region features, so that the network can learn the object
features more comprehensively. The DC-SPP-YOLO model is established and trained
based on a new loss function composed of mean square error and cross entropy,
and the object detection is realized. Experiments demonstrate that the mAP
(mean Average Precision) of DC-SPP-YOLO proposed on PASCAL VOC datasets and
UA-DETRAC datasets is higher than that of YOLOv2; the object detection accuracy
of DC-SPP-YOLO is superior to YOLOv2 by strengthening feature extraction and
using the multi-scale local region features.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
EHAAS: Energy Harvesters As A Sensor for Place Recognition on Wearables,"Yoshinori Umetsu, Yugo Nakamura, Yutaka Arakawa, Manato Fujimoto, Hirohiko Suwa","A wearable based long-term lifelogging system is desirable for the purpose of
reviewing and improving users' lifestyle habits. Energy harvesting (EH) is a
promising means for realizing sustainable lifelogging. However, present EH
technologies suffer from instability of the generated electricity caused by
changes of environment, e.g., the output of a solar cell varies based on its
material, light intensity, and light wavelength. In this paper, we leverage
this instability of EH technologies for other purposes, in addition to its use
as an energy source. Specifically, we propose to determine the variation of
generated electricity as a sensor for recognizing ""places"" where the user
visits, which is important information in the lifelogging system. First, we
investigate the amount of generated electricity of selected energy harvesting
elements in various environments. Second, we design a system called EHAAS
(Energy Harvesters As A Sensor) where energy harvesting elements are used as a
sensor. With EHAAS, we propose a place recognition method based on
machine-learning and implement a prototype wearable system. Our prototype
evaluation confirms that EHAAS achieves a place recognition accuracy of 88.5%
F-value for nine different indoor and outdoor places. This result is better
than the results of existing sensors (3-axis accelerometer and brightness). We
also clarify that only two types of solar cells are required for recognizing a
place with 86.2% accuracy.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
A Graph-structured Dataset for Wikipedia Research,"Nicolas Aspert, Volodymyr Miz, Benjamin Ricaud, Pierre Vandergheynst","Wikipedia is a rich and invaluable source of information. Its central place
on the Web makes it a particularly interesting object of study for scientists.
Researchers from different domains used various complex datasets related to
Wikipedia to study language, social behavior, knowledge organization, and
network theory. While being a scientific treasure, the large size of the
dataset hinders pre-processing and may be a challenging obstacle for potential
new studies. This issue is particularly acute in scientific domains where
researchers may not be technically and data processing savvy. On one hand, the
size of Wikipedia dumps is large. It makes the parsing and extraction of
relevant information cumbersome. On the other hand, the API is straightforward
to use but restricted to a relatively small number of requests. The middle
ground is at the mesoscopic scale when researchers need a subset of Wikipedia
ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of pages but there exists no
efficient solution at this scale.
In this work, we propose an efficient data structure to make requests and
access subnetworks of Wikipedia pages and categories. We provide convenient
tools for accessing and filtering viewership statistics or ""pagecounts"" of
Wikipedia web pages. The dataset organization leverages principles of graph
databases that allows rapid and intuitive access to subgraphs of Wikipedia

Contextual Bandits with Random Projection,Xiaotian Yu,"Contextual bandits with linear payoffs, which are also known as linear
bandits, provide a powerful alternative for solving practical problems of
sequential decisions, e.g., online advertisements. In the era of big data,
contextual data usually tend to be high-dimensional, which leads to new
challenges for traditional linear bandits mostly designed for the setting of
low-dimensional contextual data. Due to the curse of dimensionality, there are
two challenges in most of the current bandit algorithms: the first is high
time-complexity; and the second is extreme large upper regret bounds with
high-dimensional data. In this paper, in order to attack the above two
challenges effectively, we develop an algorithm of Contextual Bandits via
RAndom Projection (\texttt{CBRAP}) in the setting of linear payoffs, which
works especially for high-dimensional contextual data. The proposed
\texttt{CBRAP} algorithm is time-efficient and flexible, because it enables
players to choose an arm in a low-dimensional space, and relaxes the sparsity
assumption of constant number of non-zero components in previous work. Besides,
we provide a linear upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which is
associated with reduced dimensions.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Almost Tight Lower Bounds for Hard Cutting Problems in Embedded Graphs,"Vincent Cohen-Addad, Éric Colin de Verdière, Daniel Marx, Arnaud de Mesmay","We prove essentially tight lower bounds, conditionally to the Exponential
Time Hypothesis, for two fundamental but seemingly very different cutting
problems on surface-embedded graphs: the Shortest Cut Graph problem and the
Multiway Cut problem. A cut graph of a graph $G$ embedded on a surface $S$ is a
subgraph of $G$ whose removal from $S$ leaves a disk. We consider the problem
of deciding whether an unweighted graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ has
a cut graph of length at most a given value. We prove a time lower bound for
this problem of $n^{\Omega(g/\log g)}$ conditionally to ETH. In other words,
the first $n^{O(g)}$-time algorithm by Erickson and Har-Peled [SoCG 2002,
Discr.\ Comput.\ Geom.\ 2004] is essentially optimal. We also prove that the
problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the genus, answering a 17-year old
question of these authors. A multiway cut of an undirected graph $G$ with $t$
distinguished vertices, called terminals, is a set of edges whose removal
disconnects all pairs of terminals. We consider the problem of deciding whether
an unweighted graph $G$ has a multiway cut of weight at most a given value. We
prove a time lower bound for this problem of $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{gt +
g^2+t}/\log(g+t))}$, conditionally to ETH, for any choice of the genus $g\ge0$
of the graph and the number of terminals $t\ge4$. In other words, the algorithm
by the second author [Algorithmica 2017] (for the more general multicut
problem) is essentially optimal; this extends the lower bound by the third
author [ICALP 2012] (for the planar case). Reductions to planar problems
usually involve a grid-like structure. The main novel idea for our results is
to understand what structures instead of grids are needed if we want to exploit

Iterated Extended Kalman Smoother-based Variable Splitting for $L_1$-Regularized State Estimation,"Rui Gao, Filip Tronarp, Simo Särkkä","In this paper, we propose a new framework for solving state estimation
problems with an additional sparsity-promoting $L_1$-regularizer term. We first
formulate such problems as minimization of the sum of linear or nonlinear
quadratic error terms and an extra regularizer, and then present novel
algorithms which solve the linear and nonlinear cases. The methods are based on
a combination of the iterated extended Kalman smoother and variable splitting
techniques such as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We
present a general algorithmic framework for variable splitting methods, where
the iterative steps involving minimization of the nonlinear quadratic terms can
be computed efficiently by iterated smoothing. Due to the use of state
estimation algorithms, the proposed framework has a low per-iteration time
complexity, which makes it suitable for solving a large-scale or

Joint User Association and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks: Comparison of Two Modeling Approaches,"Dariush Fooladivanda, Catherine Rosenberg","The performance of different combinations of user association (UA) and
resource allocation (RA) in heterogeneous cellular networks has been
extensively studied using a classic modeling approach based on system
snapshots. There have been also many studies focusing on the dynamics of the
system using queueing models. These modeling approaches are rarely compared
with each other though they each bring different insights to the design
problem. In this paper, we consider a queueing model-based approach to study
the interplay of UA and RA, and compare the results to those obtained using
snapshot models. Specifically, we formulate three different joint UA and RA
optimization problems corresponding to the following three performance metrics:
the maximum achievable arrival rate, the average system delay, and the maximum
per-user delay. These problems are non-convex integer programs. We have
therefore developed numerical techniques to compute either their exact
solutions or tight lower bounds. We obtain results for different combinations
of RA and UA schemes, and compare the trends with those obtained via the
snapshot approach. The trends on RA are very similar, which we take as a
cross-validation of the two modeling approaches for this kind of problem. The
trends on user association are somewhat different which indicates a lack of
robustness of the results and the need for a careful validation of UA models.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),,[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]

reconstruction methods from undersampled datasets. In this article, we describe
the use of ""plug-and-play"" (PnP) algorithms for MRI image recovery. We first
describe the linearly approximated inverse problem encountered in MRI. Then we
review several PnP methods, where the unifying commonality is to iteratively
call a denoising subroutine as one step of a larger optimization-inspired
algorithm. Next, we describe how the result of the PnP method can be
interpreted as a solution to an equilibrium equation, allowing convergence

Fast learning synapses with molecular spin valves via selective magnetic potentiation,"Alberto Riminucci, Robert Legenstein","We studied LSMO/Alq3/AlOx/Co molecular spin valves in view of their use as
synapses in neuromorphic computing. In neuromorphic computing, the learning
ability is embodied in specific changes of the synaptic weight. In this
perspective, the relevant parameter is the conductance of the molecular spin
valve, which plays the role of the synaptic weight. In this work we
demonstrated that the conductance can be changes by the repeated application of
voltage pulses. We studied the parameter space of the pulses in order to
determine the most effective voltage and duration of the pulses. The
conductance could also be modified by aligning the magnetizations of the
ferromagnetic electrodes parallel or anti parallel to each other. This
phenomenon, known as magnetoresistance, affects high conductance devices while
leaving low conductance devices unaffected. We studied how this weight update
rule affected the speed of reward-based learning in an actor-critic framework,
compared to a linear update rule. This nonlinear update performed significantly
better (50 learning trials; Epochs to reach a performance goal of 0.975 was
896+/-301 in the nonlinear case and 1076+/-484 in the nonlinear case; Welch

An Efficient Schmidt-EKF for 3D Visual-Inertial SLAM,"Patrick Geneva, James Maley, Guoquan Huang","It holds great implications for practical applications to enable
centimeter-accuracy positioning for mobile and wearable sensor systems. In this
paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM
algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU
measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D
motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman
filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state
vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they
become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational
savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their
covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their
cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear
computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the
standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound
navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature
matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual
measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated

An Optimal Task Allocation Strategy for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems,"Gennaro Notomista, Siddharth Mayya, Seth Hutchinson, Magnus Egerstedt","For a team of heterogeneous robots executing multiple tasks, we propose a

many real-world applications of remaining operational for long periods of time,
we allow each robot to choose tasks taking into account the energy consumed by
executing them, besides the global specifications on the task allocation. The
tasks are encoded as constraints in an energy minimization problem solved at
each point in time by each robot. The prioritization of a task over others --
effectively signifying the allocation of the task to that particular robot --
occurs via the introduction of slack variables in the task constraints.
Moreover, the suitabilities of certain robots towards certain tasks are also
taken into account to generate a task allocation algorithm for a team of robots
with heterogeneous capabilities. The efficacy of the developed approach is

to avoid a degeneracy of zero photometric gradients via rasterizing from a

Online Gaussian Process State-Space Model: Learning and Planning for Partially Observable Dynamical Systems,"Soon-Seo Park, Young-Jin Park, Youngjae Min, Han-Lim Choi","This paper proposes an online learning method of Gaussian process state-space
model (GP-SSM). GP-SSM is a probabilistic representation learning scheme that
represents unknown state transition and/or measurement models as Gaussian

are focused on processing a given set of time series data, data may arrive and
accumulate sequentially over time in most dynamical systems. Storing all such
sequential data and updating the model over entire data incur large amount of
computational resources in space and time. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose a practical method, termed \textit{onlineGPSSM}, that incorporates
stochastic variational inference (VI) and online VI with novel formulation. The
proposed method mitigates the computational complexity without catastrophic
forgetting and also support adaptation to changes in a system and/or a real

Gradient based sample selection for online continual learning,"Rahaf Aljundi, Min Lin, Baptiste Goujaud, Yoshua Bengio","A continual learning agent learns online with a non-stationary and

works often depend on task boundary and i.i.d. assumptions to properly select
samples for the replay buffer. In this work, we formulate sample selection as a
constraint reduction problem based on the constrained optimization view of
continual learning. The goal is to select a fixed subset of constraints that
best approximate the feasible region defined by the original constraints. We
show that it is equivalent to maximizing the diversity of samples in the replay
buffer with parameters gradient as the feature. We further develop a greedy
alternative that is cheap and efficient. The advantage of the proposed method

that it is possible to combine visual and textual information in order to
ground translations. In this paper we probe the contribution of the visual
modality to state-of-the-art MMT models by conducting a systematic analysis
where we partially deprive the models from source-side textual context. Our
results show that under limited textual context, models are capable of

Efficient Inner Product Approximation in Hybrid Spaces,"Xiang Wu, Ruiqi Guo, David Simcha, Dave Dopson, Sanjiv Kumar","Many emerging use cases of data mining and machine learning operate on large
datasets with data from heterogeneous sources, specifically with both sparse
and dense components. For example, dense deep neural network embedding vectors
are often used in conjunction with sparse textual features to provide high
dimensional hybrid representation of documents. Efficient search in such hybrid
spaces is very challenging as the techniques that perform well for sparse
vectors have little overlap with those that work well for dense vectors.
Popular techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its data-dependent
variants also do not give good accuracy in high dimensional hybrid spaces. Even
though hybrid scenarios are becoming more prevalent, currently there exist no
efficient techniques in literature that are both fast and accurate. In this
paper, we propose a technique that approximates the inner product computation
in hybrid vectors, leading to substantial speedup in search while maintaining
high accuracy. We also propose efficient data structures that exploit modern
computer architectures, resulting in orders of magnitude faster search than the
existing baselines. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on
several datasets including a very large scale industrial dataset containing one
billion vectors in a billion dimensional space, achieving over 10x speedup and
higher accuracy against competitive baselines.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Using Local Experiences for Global Motion Planning,"Constantinos Chamzas, Anshumali Shrivastava, Lydia E. Kavraki","Sampling-based planners are effective in many real-world applications such as
robotics manipulation, navigation, and even protein modeling. However, it is
often challenging to generate a collision-free path in environments where key
areas are hard to sample. In the absence of any prior information,
sampling-based planners are forced to explore uniformly or heuristically, which
can lead to degraded performance. One way to improve performance is to use
prior knowledge of environments to adapt the sampling strategy to the problem
at hand. In this work, we decompose the workspace into local primitives,
memorizing local experiences by these primitives in the form of local samplers,
and store them in a database. We synthesize an efficient global sampler by
retrieving local experiences relevant to the given situation. Our method
transfers knowledge effectively between diverse environments that share local
primitives and speeds up the performance dramatically. Our results show, in
terms of solution time, an improvement of multiple orders of magnitude in two
traditionally challenging high-dimensional problems compared to

LaserNet: An Efficient Probabilistic 3D Object Detector for Autonomous Driving,"Gregory P. Meyer, Ankit Laddha, Eric Kee, Carlos Vallespi-Gonzalez, Carl K. Wellington","In this paper, we present LaserNet, a computationally efficient method for 3D
object detection from LiDAR data for autonomous driving. The efficiency results
from processing LiDAR data in the native range view of the sensor, where the
input data is naturally compact. Operating in the range view involves well
known challenges for learning, including occlusion and scale variation, but it
also provides contextual information based on how the sensor data was captured.
Our approach uses a fully convolutional network to predict a multimodal
distribution over 3D boxes for each point and then it efficiently fuses these
distributions to generate a prediction for each object. Experiments show that
modeling each detection as a distribution rather than a single deterministic
box leads to better overall detection performance. Benchmark results show that
this approach has significantly lower runtime than other recent detectors and
that it achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared on a large dataset
that has enough data to overcome the challenges of training on the range view.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),; Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]
Accelerating Gradient Boosting Machine,"Haihao Lu, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Natalia Ponomareva, Vahab Mirrokni","Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is an extremely powerful supervised learning
algorithm that is widely used in practice. GBM routinely features as a leading
algorithm in machine learning competitions such as Kaggle and the KDDCup. In
this work, we propose Accelerated Gradient Boosting Machine (AGBM) by
incorporating Nesterov's acceleration techniques into the design of GBM. The
difficulty in accelerating GBM lies in the fact that weak (inexact) learners
are commonly used, and therefore the errors can accumulate in the momentum
term. To overcome it, we design a ""corrected pseudo residual"" and fit best weak
learner to this corrected pseudo residual, in order to perform the z-update.
Thus, we are able to derive novel computational guarantees for AGBM. This is
the first GBM type of algorithm with theoretically-justified accelerated
convergence rate. Finally we demonstrate with a number of numerical experiments
the effectiveness of AGBM over conventional GBM in obtaining a model with good
training and/or testing data fidelity.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 27 Aug 2020 (this version, v3)]"
Simplex space-time meshes in thermally coupled two-phase flow simulations of mold filling,"Violeta Karyofylli, Loic Wendling, Michel Make, Norbert Hosters, Marek Behr","The quality of plastic parts produced through injection molding depends on
many factors. Especially during the filling stage, defects such as weld lines,
burrs, or insufficient filling can occur. Numerical methods need to be employed
to improve product quality by means of predicting and simulating the injection
molding process. In the current work, a highly viscous incompressible
non-isothermal two-phase flow is simulated, which takes place during the cavity
filling. The injected melt exhibits a shear-thinning behavior, which is
described by the Carreau-WLF model. Besides that, a novel discretization method
is used in the context of 4D simplex space-time grids [2]. This method allows
for local temporal refinement in the vicinity of, e.g., the evolving front of
the melt [10]. Utilizing such an adaptive refinement can lead to locally

Digital Memcomputing: from Logic to Dynamics to Topology,"Massimiliano Di Ventra, Igor V. Ovchinnikov","Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are a class of computational machines
designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. A practical realization
of DMMs can be accomplished via electrical circuits of highly non-linear,
point-dissipative dynamical systems engineered so that periodic orbits and
chaos can be avoided. A given logic problem is first mapped into this type of
dynamical system whose point attractors represent the solutions of the original
problem. A DMM then finds the solution via a succession of elementary
instantons whose role is to eliminate solitonic configurations of logical
inconsistency (""logical defects"") from the circuit. By employing a
supersymmetric theory of dynamics, a DMM can be described by a cohomological
field theory that allows for computation of certain topological matrix elements
on instantons that have the mathematical meaning of intersection numbers on
instantons. We discuss the ""dynamical"" meaning of these matrix elements, and
argue that the number of elementary instantons needed to reach the solution
cannot exceed the number of state variables of DMMs, which in turn can only
grow at most polynomially with the size of the problem. These results shed

Batch Policy Learning under Constraints,"Hoang M. Le, Cameron Voloshin, Yisong Yue","When learning policies for real-world domains, two important questions arise:
(i) how to efficiently use pre-collected off-policy, non-optimal behavior data;

We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints,
and offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm

Affordance Learning In Direct Perception for Autonomous Driving,"Chen Sun, Jean M. Uwabeza Vianney, Dongpu Cao","Recent development in autonomous driving involves high-level computer vision
and detailed road scene understanding. Today, most autonomous vehicles are
using mediated perception approach for path planning and control, which highly
rely on high-definition 3D maps and real time sensors. Recent research efforts

to develop the affordance learning model based on freely available Google

Byzantine Fault Tolerant Distributed Linear Regression,"Nirupam Gupta, Nitin H. Vaidya","This paper considers the problem of Byzantine fault tolerance in distributed
linear regression in a multi-agent system. However, the proposed algorithms are
given for a more general class of distributed optimization problems, of which
distributed linear regression is a special case. The system comprises of a
server and multiple agents, where each agent is holding a certain number of
data points and responses that satisfy a linear relationship (could be noisy).
The objective of the server is to determine this relationship, given that some
of the agents in the system (up to a known number) are Byzantine faulty (aka.
actively adversarial). We show that the server can achieve this objective, in a
deterministic manner, by robustifying the original distributed gradient descent
method using norm based filters, namely 'norm filtering' and 'norm-cap
filtering', incurring an additional log-linear computation cost in each
iteration. The proposed algorithms improve upon the existing methods on three
levels: i) no assumptions are required on the probability distribution of data
points, ii) system can be partially asynchronous, and iii) the computational
overhead (in order to handle Byzantine faulty agents) is log-linear in number
of agents and linear in dimension of data points. The proposed algorithms

Using Ego-Clusters to Measure Network Effects at LinkedIn,"Guillaume Saint-Jacques, Maneesh Varshney, Jeremy Simpson, Ya Xu","A network effect is said to take place when a new feature not only impacts
the people who receive it, but also other users of the platform, like their
connections or the people who follow them. This very common phenomenon violates
the fundamental assumption underpinning nearly all enterprise experimentation
systems, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). When this
assumption is broken, a typical experimentation platform, which relies on
Bernoulli randomization for assignment and two-sample t-test for assessment of
significance, will not only fail to account for the network effect, but
potentially give highly biased results.
This paper outlines a simple and scalable solution to measuring network
effects, using ego-network randomization, where a cluster is comprised of an
""ego"" (a focal individual), and her ""alters"" (the individuals she is
immediately connected to). Our approach aims at maintaining representativity of
clusters, avoiding strong modeling assumption, and significantly increasing
power compared to traditional cluster-based randomization. In particular, it
does not require product-specific experiment design, or high levels of
investment from engineering teams, and does not require any changes to
experimentation and analysis platforms, as it only requires assigning treatment
an individual level. Each user either has the feature or does not, and no
complex manipulation of interactions between users is needed. It focuses on
measuring the one-out network effect (i.e the effect of my immediate
connection's treatment on me), and gives reasonable estimates at a very low
setup cost, allowing us to run such experiments dozens of times a year.",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),; Applications (stat.AP),[Submitted on 20 Mar 2019]

with purely theoretical approaches, the resulting architecture should be usable

Thus predicting segmentation quality without ground truth would be very crucial

Fault-Tolerant Nanosatellite Computing on a Budget,"Christian M. Fuchs, Nadia Murillo, Aske Plaat, Erik Van der Kouwe, Daniel Harsono, Todor Stefanov","Micro- and nanosatellites have become popular platforms for a variety of
commercial and scientific applications, but today are considered suitable
mainly for short and low-priority space missions due to their low reliability.
In part, this can be attributed to their reliance upon cheap, low-feature size,
COTS components originally designed for embedded and mobile-market
applications, for which traditional hardware-voting concepts are ineffective.
Software-fault-tolerance concepts have been shown effective for such systems,

Interpreting Neural Networks Using Flip Points,"Roozbeh Yousefzadeh, Dianne P. O'Leary","Neural networks have been criticized for their lack of easy interpretation,
which undermines confidence in their use for important applications. Here, we
introduce a novel technique, interpreting a trained neural network by
investigating its flip points. A flip point is any point that lies on the
boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a neural network with a binary
yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal scores for ""yes""
and ""no"". The flip point closest to a given input is of particular importance,
and this point is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. This paper
gives an overview of the uses of flip points and how they are computed. Through
results on standard datasets, we demonstrate how flip points can be used to
provide detailed interpretation of the output produced by a neural network.
Moreover, for a given input, flip points enable us to measure confidence in the
correctness of outputs much more effectively than softmax score. They also
identify influential features of the inputs, identify bias, and find changes in
the input that change the output of the model. We show that distance between an
input and the closest flip point identifies the most influential points in the
training data. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and rank-revealing QR
factorization (RR-QR), the set of directions from each training input to its
closest flip point provides explanations of how a trained neural network
processes an entire dataset: what features are most important for
classification into a given class, which features are most responsible for
particular misclassifications, how an adversary might fool the network, etc.
Although we investigate flip points for neural networks, their usefulness is

End-to-End Safe Reinforcement Learning through Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Continuous Control Tasks,"Richard Cheng, Gabor Orosz, Richard M. Murray, Joel W. Burdick","Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond
simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees
during the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or
break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we
propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based
controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions
(CBFs) and (3) on-line learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to
ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of
RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based
controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by
constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs)
to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties.
Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high
probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used,
and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm
on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous car-following with

Parallel Batch-Dynamic Graph Connectivity,"Umut A. Acar, Daniel Anderson, Guy E. Blelloch, Laxman Dhulipala","In this paper, we study batch parallel algorithms for the dynamic
connectivity problem, a fundamental problem that has received considerable
attention in the sequential setting. The most well known sequential algorithm
for dynamic connectivity is the elegant level-set algorithm of Holm, de
Lichtenberg and Thorup (HDT), which achieves $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized time per
edge insertion or deletion, and $O(\log n / \log\log n)$ time per query. We
design a parallel batch-dynamic connectivity algorithm that is work-efficient
with respect to the HDT algorithm for small batch sizes, and is asymptotically
faster when the average batch size is sufficiently large. Given a sequence of
batched updates, where $\Delta$ is the average batch size of all deletions, our
algorithm achieves $O(\log n \log(1 + n / \Delta))$ expected amortized work per
edge insertion and deletion and $O(\log^3 n)$ depth w.h.p. Our algorithm
answers a batch of $k$ connectivity queries in $O(k \log(1 + n/k))$ expected
work and $O(\log n)$ depth w.h.p. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm

A Unified Analytical Framework for Trustable Machine Learning and Automation Running with Blockchain,Tao Wang,"Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are
mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine
learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a
trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can
store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are
used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three
contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology
and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have
been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second,
it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by
using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the
trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a
computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread
on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with
blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining
as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented
with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid
prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
Prevention and Mitigation of Catastrophic Failures in Demand-Supply Interdependent Networks,"Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Jiayu Mao, Do Young Eun, Huaiyu Dai","We propose a generic system model for a special category of interdependent
networks, demand-supply networks, in which the demand and the supply nodes are
associated with heterogeneous loads and resources, respectively. Our model
sheds a light on a unique cascading failure mechanism induced by resource/load
fluctuations, which in turn opens the door to conducting stress analysis on
interdependent networks. Compared to the existing literature mainly concerned
with the node connectivity, we focus on developing effective resource
allocation methods to prevent these cascading failures from happening and to
mitigate/confine them upon occurrence in the network. To prevent cascading
failures, we identify some dangerous stress mechanisms, based on which we
quantify the robustness of the network in terms of the resource configuration
scheme. Afterward, we identify the optimal resource configuration under two
resource/load fluctuations scenarios: uniform and proportional fluctuations. We
further investigate the optimal resource configuration problem considering
heterogeneous resource sharing costs among the nodes. To mitigate/confine
ongoing cascading failures, we propose two network adaptations mechanisms:
intentional failure and resource re-adjustment, based on which we propose an
algorithm to mitigate an ongoing cascading failure while reinforcing the
surviving network with a high robustness to avoid further failures.",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),,"[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 6 Nov 2019 (this version, v3)]"
RAIRE: Risk-Limiting Audits for IRV Elections,"Michelle Blom, Peter J. Stuckey, Vanessa Teague","Risk-limiting post election audits guarantee a high probability of correcting
incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

Networks for Joint Affine and Non-parametric Image Registration,"Zhengyang Shen, Xu Han, Zhenlin Xu, Marc Niethammer","We introduce an end-to-end deep-learning framework for 3D medical image
registration. In contrast to existing approaches, our framework combines two
registration methods: an affine registration and a vector
momentum-parameterized stationary velocity field (vSVF) model. Specifically, it
consists of three stages. In the first stage, a multi-step affine network
predicts affine transform parameters. In the second stage, we use a Unet-like
network to generate a momentum, from which a velocity field can be computed via
smoothing. Finally, in the third stage, we employ a self-iterable map-based
vSVF component to provide a non-parametric refinement based on the current
estimate of the transformation map. Once the model is trained, a registration
is completed in one forward pass. To evaluate the performance, we conducted
longitudinal and cross-subject experiments on 3D magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of the knee of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. Results show
that our framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art medical

Dual Residual Networks Leveraging the Potential of Paired Operations for Image Restoration,"Xing Liu, Masanori Suganuma, Zhun Sun, Takayuki Okatani","In this paper, we study design of deep neural networks for tasks of image
restoration. We propose a novel style of residual connections dubbed ""dual
residual connection"", which exploits the potential of paired operations, e.g.,
up- and down-sampling or convolution with large- and small-size kernels. We
design a modular block implementing this connection style; it is equipped with
two containers to which arbitrary paired operations are inserted. Adopting the
""unraveled"" view of the residual networks proposed by Veit et al., we point out
that a stack of the proposed modular blocks allows the first operation in a
block interact with the second operation in any subsequent blocks. Specifying
the two operations in each of the stacked blocks, we build a complete network
for each individual task of image restoration. We experimentally evaluate the
proposed approach on five image restoration tasks using nine datasets. The
results show that the proposed networks with properly chosen paired operations

Contingency Model Predictive Control for Automated Vehicles,"John P. Alsterda, Matthew Brown, J. Christian Gerdes","We present Contingency Model Predictive Control (CMPC), a novel and
implementable control framework which tracks a desired path while
simultaneously maintaining a contingency plan -- an alternate trajectory to
avert an identified potential emergency. In this way, CMPC anticipates events
that might take place, instead of reacting when emergencies occur. We
accomplish this by adding an additional prediction horizon in parallel to the
classical receding MPC horizon. The contingency horizon is constrained to
maintain a feasible avoidance solution; as such, CMPC is selectively robust to
this emergency while tracking the desired path as closely as possible. After
defining the framework mathematically, we demonstrate its effectiveness
experimentally by comparing its performance to a state-of-the-art deterministic
MPC. The controllers drive an automated research platform through a left-hand
turn which may be covered by ice. Contingency MPC prepares for the potential
loss of friction by purposefully and intuitively deviating from the prescribed

Semantic Security on Wiretap Channels using Universal Hashing with Fading Applications,"Eric Kubischta, Parker Pavlicek, Sanjay Karmakar","We furnish a procedure based on universal hash families (UHFs) that can
convert an error correcting coding scheme (ECC) of rate $R$ into a semantically
secure wiretap coding scheme of rate $R - \xi$ where $\xi$ is a parameter
derived from the eavesdropper's point-to-point channel. This conversion is
shown to be polynomial time efficient with block length and is applicable to
any channel. When an ECC is chosen, our procedure induces a wiretap coding
scheme that is concrete and efficient as long as the ECC is also such. To prove
this induced wiretap coding scheme is semantically secure, we have constructed
bounds on the information leaked to the eavesdropper. Our construction is an
upgrade of bounds from recent literature: the novelty here being that our
leakage bounds hold for any message distribution. Indeed, our wiretap procedure
using UHFs and our characterization of its semantic leakage is the first main
contribution of this work. The other main contribution of this work is as
follows. We apply the aforementioned procedure to a variety of wiretap channels

On Preempting Advanced Persistent Threats Using Probabilistic Graphical Models,Phuong Cao,"This paper presents PULSAR, a framework for pre-empting Advanced Persistent

Non-target Structural Displacement Measurement Using Reference Frame Based Deepflow,"Jongbin Won, Jong-Woong Park, Do-Soo Moon","Structural displacement is crucial for structural health monitoring, although
it is very challenging to measure in field conditions. Most existing
displacement measurement methods are costly, labor intensive, and
insufficiently accurate for measuring small dynamic displacements. Computer
vision (CV) based methods incorporate optical devices with advanced image
processing algorithms to accurately, cost-effectively, and remotely measure
structural displacement with easy installation. However, non-target based CV
methods are still limited by insufficient feature points, incorrect feature
point detection, occlusion, and drift induced by tracking error accumulation.
This paper presents a reference frame based Deepflow algorithm integrated with
masking and signal filtering for non-target based displacement measurements.
The proposed method allows the user to select points of interest for images
with a low gradient for displacement tracking and directly calculate
displacement without drift accumulated by measurement error. The proposed
method is experimentally validated on a cantilevered beam under ambient and
occluded test conditions. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with
that of a reference laser displacement sensor for validation. The significant

displacement in any region on structures that do not have distinct natural

Towards Robust Curve Text Detection with Conditional Spatial Expansion,"Zichuan Liu, Guosheng Lin, Sheng Yang, Fayao Liu, Weisi Lin, Wang Ling Goh","It is challenging to detect curve texts due to their irregular shapes and
varying sizes. In this paper, we first investigate the deficiency of the
existing curve detection methods and then propose a novel Conditional Spatial
Expansion (CSE) mechanism to improve the performance of curve text detection.
Instead of regarding the curve text detection as a polygon regression or a
segmentation problem, we treat it as a region expansion process. Our CSE starts
with a seed arbitrarily initialized within a text region and progressively
merges neighborhood regions based on the extracted local features by a CNN and
contextual information of merged regions. The CSE is highly parameterized and
can be seamlessly integrated into existing object detection frameworks.
Enhanced by the data-dependent CSE mechanism, our curve text detection system
provides robust instance-level text region extraction with minimal
post-processing. The analysis experiment shows that our CSE can handle texts
with various shapes, sizes, and orientations, and can effectively suppress the
false-positives coming from text-like textures or unexpected texts included in
the same RoI. Compared with the existing curve text detection algorithms, our
method is more robust and enjoys a simpler processing flow. It also creates a

Weakly-Supervised Discovery of Geometry-Aware Representation for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Xipeng Chen, Kwan-Yee Lin, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, Xiaogang Wang, Liang Lin","Recent studies have shown remarkable advances in 3D human pose estimation
from monocular images, with the help of large-scale in-door 3D datasets and
sophisticated network architectures. However, the generalizability to different
environments remains an elusive goal. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware
3D representation for the human pose to address this limitation by using
multiple views in a simple auto-encoder model at the training stage and only 2D
keypoint information as supervision. A view synthesis framework is proposed to
learn the shared 3D representation between viewpoints with synthesizing the
human pose from one viewpoint to the other one. Instead of performing a direct
transfer in the raw image-level, we propose a skeleton-based encoder-decoder
mechanism to distil only pose-related representation in the latent space. A
learning-based representation consistency constraint is further introduced to
facilitate the robustness of latent 3D representation. Since the learnt
representation encodes 3D geometry information, mapping it to 3D pose will be
much easier than conventional frameworks that use an image or 2D coordinates as
the input of 3D pose estimator. We demonstrate our approach on the task of 3D

evaluate the feasibility of the proposed idea. Simulation results indicate that
there is an optimal number of users which can minimize the performance
deterioration. Moreover, the simulation results also show that slight

Linguistic Knowledge and Transferability of Contextual Representations,"Nelson F. Liu, Matt Gardner, Yonatan Belinkov, Matthew E. Peters, Noah A. Smith","Contextual word representations derived from large-scale neural language
models are successful across a diverse set of NLP tasks, suggesting that they

linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the representations produced by
several recent pretrained contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAI

tasks. We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextual
representations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models in
many cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge
(e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability of
contextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferability
of individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNs
are more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the same
monotonic trend. In addition, to better understand what makes contextual word
representations transferable, we compare language model pretraining with eleven
supervised pretraining tasks. For any given task, pretraining on a closely

automatic discriminative analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning
methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very
recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a
single type of connectivity measure. We propose a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram

aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various
connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of
effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial
directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design
a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of
1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions
using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned
by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent
group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large
resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform
traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined
connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs
using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of $93.06\%$ with a

Cognitive Wireless Power Transfer in the Presence of Reactive Primary Communication User,"Tianxin Feng, Ganggang Ma, Jie Xu","This paper studies a cognitive or secondary multi-antenna wireless power
transfer (WPT) system over a multi-carrier channel, which shares the same
spectrum with a primary wireless information transfer (WIT) system that employs
adaptive water-filling power allocation. By controlling the transmit energy
beamforming over sub-carriers (SCs), the secondary energy transmitter (S-ET)
can directly charge the secondary energy receiver (S-ER), even purposely
interfere with the primary WIT system, such that the primary information
transmitter (P-IT) can reactively adjust its power allocation (based on
water-filling) to facilitate the S-ER's energy harvesting. We investigate how
the secondary WPT system can exploit the primary WIT system's reactive power
allocation, for improving the wireless energy harvesting performance. In
particular, our objective is to maximize the total energy received at the S-ER
from both the S-ET and the P-IT, by optimizing the S-ET's energy beamforming
over SCs, subject to its maximum transmit power constraint, and the maximum
interference power constraint imposed at the primary information receiver
(P-IR) to protect the primary WIT. Although the formulated problem is
non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved in general, we propose an
efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by employing the Lagrange
dual method together with a one-dimensional search. We also present two

pentatope (for 3D problems) meshes, offers an efficient yet accurate approach
to the underlying two-phase flow problems.","Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE)",; Numerical Analysis (math.NA),[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
Tensor-Ring Nuclear Norm Minimization and Application for Visual Data Completion,"Jinshi Yu, Chao Li, Qibin Zhao, Guoxu Zhou","Tensor ring (TR) decomposition has been successfully used to obtain the
state-of-the-art performance in the visual data completion problem. However,
the existing TR-based completion methods are severely non-convex and
computationally demanding. In addition, the determination of the optimal TR
rank is a tough work in practice. To overcome these drawbacks, we first
introduce a class of new tensor nuclear norms by using tensor circular
unfolding. Then we theoretically establish connection between the rank of the
circularly-unfolded matrices and the TR ranks. We also develop an efficient
tensor completion algorithm by minimizing the proposed tensor nuclear norm.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed tensor completion
method outperforms the conventional tensor completion methods in the
image/video in-painting problem with striped missing values.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
Node Embedding over Temporal Graphs,"Uriel Singer, Ido Guy, Kira Radinsky","In this work, we present a method for node embedding in temporal graphs. We
propose an algorithm that learns the evolution of a temporal graph's nodes and
edges over time and incorporates this dynamics in a temporal node embedding
framework for different graph prediction tasks. We present a joint loss
function that creates a temporal embedding of a node by learning to combine its
historical temporal embeddings, such that it optimizes per given task (e.g.,
link prediction). The algorithm is initialized using static node embeddings,
which are then aligned over the representations of a node at different time
points, and eventually adapted for the given task in a joint optimization. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a variety of temporal graphs
for the two fundamental tasks of temporal link prediction and multi-label node
classification, comparing to competitive baselines and algorithmic
alternatives. Our algorithm shows performance improvements across many of the
datasets and baselines and is found particularly effective for graphs that are
less cohesive, with a lower clustering coefficient.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Social and Information Networks (cs.SI); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 2 Apr 2019 (this version, v2)]"
Context-Constrained Accurate Contour Extraction for Occlusion Edge Detection,"Rui Lu, Menghan Zhou, Anlong Ming, Yu Zhou","Occlusion edge detection requires both accurate locations and context
constraints of the contour. Existing CNN-based pipeline does not utilize
adaptive methods to filter the noise introduced by low-level features. To
address this dilemma, we propose a novel Context-constrained accurate Contour
Extraction Network (CCENet). Spatial details are retained and contour-sensitive
context is augmented through two extraction blocks, respectively. Then, an
elaborately designed fusion module is available to integrate features, which
plays a complementary role to restore details and remove clutter. Weight
response of attention mechanism is eventually utilized to enhance occluded
contours and suppress noise. The proposed CCENet significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on PIOD and BSDS ownership dataset of object edge
detection and occlusion orientation detection.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),,[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
Towards Characterizing Divergence in Deep Q-Learning,"Joshua Achiam, Ethan Knight, Pieter Abbeel","Deep Q-Learning (DQL), a family of temporal difference algorithms for
control, employs three techniques collectively known as the `deadly triad' in
reinforcement learning: bootstrapping, off-policy learning, and function
approximation. Prior work has demonstrated that together these can lead to
divergence in Q-learning algorithms, but the conditions under which divergence
occurs are not well-understood. In this note, we give a simple analysis based
on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides
insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our
analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q
update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm. Based on this analysis, we
develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous
control without any of the tricks conventionally used (such as target networks,
adaptive gradient optimizers, or using multiple Q functions). We demonstrate
that our algorithm performs above or near state-of-the-art on standard MuJoCo
benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
RAP-Net: Recurrent Attention Pooling Networks for Dialogue Response Selection,"Chao-Wei Huang, Ting-Rui Chiang, Shang-Yu Su, Yun-Nung Chen","The response selection has been an emerging research topic due to the growing
interest in dialogue modeling, where the goal of the task is to select an
appropriate response for continuing dialogues. To further push the end-to-end
dialogue model toward real-world scenarios, the seventh Dialog System
Technology Challenge (DSTC7) proposed a challenging track based on real chatlog
datasets. The competition focuses on dialogue modeling with several advanced
characteristics: (1) natural language diversity, (2) capability of precisely
selecting a proper response from a large set of candidates or the scenario
without any correct answer, and (3) knowledge grounding. This paper introduces
recurrent attention pooling networks (RAP-Net), a novel framework for response
selection, which can well estimate the relevance between the dialogue contexts
and the candidates. The proposed RAP-Net is shown to be effective and can be
generalized across different datasets and settings in the DSTC7 experiments.",Computation and Language (cs.CL),,[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
Volumetric Untrimming: Precise decomposition of trimmed trivariates into tensor products,"Fady Massarwi, Pablo Antolin, Gershon Elber","3D objects, modeled using Computer Aided Geometric Design tools, are
traditionally represented using a boundary representation (B-rep), and
typically use spline functions to parameterize these boundary surfaces.
However, recent development in physical analysis, in isogeometric analysis
(IGA) in specific, necessitates a volumetric parametrization of the interior of
the object. IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of
the volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product
B-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general
3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically
represented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality
of the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi
and Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements.
However, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more
difficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly
challenging task. In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely
decomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the
boundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify
the integration process in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first
subdivided into a set of trimmed Bézier trivariates, at all its internal
knots. Then, each trimmed Bézier trivariate, is decomposed into a set of
mutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover
the entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed
in either the Euclidean space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We
present examples on complex trimmed trivariates' based geometry, and we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the
(untrimmed) results.",Computational Geometry (cs.CG),; Numerical Analysis (math.NA),[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
PPGnet: Deep Network for Device Independent Heart Rate Estimation from Photoplethysmogram,"Shyam A, Vignesh Ravichandran, Preejith S.P, Jayaraj Joseph, Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam","Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is increasingly used to provide monitoring of the
cardiovascular system under ambulatory conditions. Wearable devices like
smartwatches use PPG to allow long term unobtrusive monitoring of heart rate in
free living conditions. PPG based heart rate measurement is unfortunately
highly susceptible to motion artifacts, particularly when measured from the
wrist. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches rely on
tri-axial accelerometer data along with PPG to perform heart rate estimation.
The conventional learning based approaches have not addressed the need for
device-specific modeling due to differences in hardware design among PPG
devices. In this paper, we propose a novel end to end deep learning model to
perform heart rate estimation using 8 second length input PPG signal. We
evaluate the proposed model on the IEEE SPC 2015 dataset, achieving a mean
absolute error of 3.36+-4.1BPM for HR estimation on 12 subjects without
requiring patient specific training. We also studied the feasibility of
applying transfer learning along with sparse retraining from a comprehensive in
house PPG dataset for heart rate estimation across PPG devices with different
hardware design.",Machine Learning (cs.LG),; Signal Processing (eess.SP); Machine Learning (stat.ML),[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019]
"Characterizing HCI Research in China: Streams, Methodologies and Future Directions","Tao Bi, Yiyi Zhang, Chongyang Wang, Amid Ayobi","This position paper takes the first step to attempt to present the initial
characterization of HCI research in China. We discuss the current streams and
methodologies of Chinese HCI research based on two well-known HCI theories:
Micro/Marco-HCI and the Three Paradigms of HCI. We evaluate the discussion with
a survey of Chinese publications at CHI 2019, which shows HCI research in China
has less attention to Macro-HCI topics and the third paradigms of HCI
(Phenomenologically situated Interaction). We then propose future HCI research
directions such as paying more attention to Macro-HCI topics and third paradigm
of HCI, combining research methodologies from multiple HCI paradigms, including
emergent users who have less access to technology, and addressing the cultural
dimensions in order to provide better technical solutions and support.",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),; Computers and Society (cs.CY),"[Submitted on 21 Mar 2019 (v1), last revised 17 May 2019 (this version, v2)]"
From Cyber-Security Deception To Manipulation and Gratification Through Gamification,"Xavier Bellekens, Gayan Jayasekara, Hanan Hindy, Miroslav Bures, David Brosset, Christos Tachtatzis, Robert Atkinson","With the ever growing networking capabilities and services offered to users,
attack surfaces have been increasing exponentially, additionally, the intricacy
of network architectures has increased the complexity of cyber-defenses, to
this end, the use of deception has recently been trending both in academia and
industry. Deception enables to create proactive defense systems, luring
attackers in order to better defend the systems at hand. Current applications
of deception, only rely on static, or low interactive environments. In this
paper we present a platform that combines human-computer-interaction,
analytics, gamification and deception to lure malicious users into selected
traps while piquing their interests. Furthermore we analyse the interactive
deceptive aspects of the platform through the addition of a narrative, further
engaging malicious users into following a predefined path and deflecting
